1. TPO 16 Planets in Our Solar System (正确率 69.03%)  
   Other dimensions along which the two groups differ markedly are density and composition. The densities of the terrestrial planets **average** about 5 times the density of water, whereas the Jovian planets have densities that average only 1.5 times the density of water. One of the outer planets, Saturn, has a density of only 0.7 that of water, which means that Saturn would float in water. Variations in the composition of the planets are largely responsible for the density differences. The substances that make up both groups of planets are divided into three groups—gases, rocks, and ices—based on their melting points. The terrestrial planets are mostly rocks: dense rocky and metallic material, with minor amounts of gases. The Jovian planets, on the other hand, <u>contain a large percentage of the gases【D】</u> hydrogen and helium, with <u>varying amounts of ices【C】</u>: mostly water, ammonia, and methane ices. 

   Q: Paragraph 4 supports each of the following statements about **Saturn** EXCEPT: 

   A.	It is **less dense** than **any** of the terrestrial planets  
   B.	It contains **no rocky material**.  
   C.	It contains **ices**.  
   D.	It contains a **large** percentage of **gases**.

2. TPO 20 Westward Migration (正确率 68.56%) 
   Two other developments presaged the end of the era of turnpikes and stared a transportation revolution that resulted in increased regional specialization and the growth of a national market economy First came the steamboat; although flatboats and keelboats continued to be important until the 1850’s, steamboats eventually superseded all other craft in the carrying of passengers and freight. Steamboats were not only faster but also transported upriver freight for about one tenth of what it had previously cost on hand-propelled keelboats. Next came the Erie Canal, an enormous project in its day, spanning about 350 miles. After the canal went into operation, <u>the cost per mile of transporting a ton of freight from Buffalo to New York City **declined** from nearly 20 cents to less that 1 cent.【B】</u> Eventually, <u>the western states **diverted** much of their produce **from** the rivers **to** the Erie Canal【D】</u>, <u>a shorter route to eastern markets</u>【A】. 

   Q: Paragraph 5 mentions that ==the Erie Canal led to a reduction in== all of the following EXCEPT 

   A.	The **length** of the route that goods from the West traveled across to reach eastern markets  
   B.	The **cost** of transporting freight  
   C.	The **price** of produce from western states

3. TPO 21 The Origins of Agriculture (正确率 68.53%)  
   How did it come about that farming developed independently in a number of world centers (the Southeast Asian mainland, Southwest Asia, Central America, lowland and highland South America, and equatorial Africa) at more or less the same time? Agriculture developed slowly among populations that had an extensive knowledge of plants and animals. <u>Changing from hunting and gathering to agriculture had no immediate advantages.</u>:star: To start with, it forced the population to <u>abandon the nomad’s life and become sedentary, to develop methods of storage</u>【C】 and, often, systems of irrigation. <u>While hunter-gatherers always had the option of **moving elsewhere** when the resources were exhausted</u>【D】, this became more difficult with farming. Furthermore, as the archaeological record shows, <u>the state of health of agriculturalists was **worse** than that of their contemporary hunter-gatherers</u>【A】.

   Q: According to paragraph 1, all of the following are **advantages** of ==hunting and gathering over agriculture== EXCEPT: 

   A.	It is **healthier** lifestyle.  
   B.	It requires **less** **knowledge** of plants and animals.  
   C.	It does **not** need **storage capabilities**.

   The same thing happens to this day, though on a smaller scale, wherever a sediment-laden river or stream emerges from a mountain valley onto relatively flat land, dropping its load as the current slows: the water usually spreads out fanwise, <u>depositing the sediment in the form of a smooth, fan-shaped slope</u>【B】. Sediments are also dropped where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea, the <u>deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the seafloor at first【C / D】</u>, but will be located inland at some future date, when the sea level falls or the land rises; such beds are sometimes thousands of meters thick.

5. :question:TPO 25 The Decline of Venetian Shipping (正确率 67.24%)  
   The problem in shipping extended to the Arsenale, Venice’s huge and powerful shipyard. Timber ran short, and it was necessary to procure it from father and father away. In ancient Roman times, the Italian peninsula had great forest of fir preferred for warships, but scarcity was apparent as early as the early fourteenth century. Arsenale officers first brought timber from the foothills of the Alps, then from north toward Trieste, and finally from across the Adriatic. Private shipbuilders were required to buy their oak abroad. As the costs of shipbuilding rose, Venice clung to its outdated standard while the Dutch were innovation in the lighter and more easily handled ships. 
   The step from buying foreign timber to buying foreign ships was regarded as a short one, especially when complaints were heard <u>in the latter sixteenth century that the standards and traditions of the Arsenale were running down</u>.:star: <u>Work was stretched out and done poorly.</u>【A】 Older workers had been allowed to stop work a half hour before the regular time, and in 1601 younger works left with them. <u>Merchants complained that the privileges reserved for Venetian-built and owned ships were first extended to those Venetians who bought ships from abroad and then to foreign-built and owned vessels</u>【D】. Historian Frederic Lane observes that after the loss of ships in battle in the late sixteenth century, the shipbuilding industry no long had the capacity to recover that it had displayed at the start of the century. 

   Q: All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 3 and 4 as contributing to ==the problems of the Venetian shipbuilding industry at the end of the sixteenth century== EXCEPT 

   A.	The **quality of work** performed in the Arsenale had **declined**  
   B.	Venetian–built ships were **heavy** and generally **inefficient**  
   C.	Arsenale shipbuilders worked **more slowly**  
   D.	**Only a few** merchants controlled the buying and selling of most of the Venetian-built ships

6. TPO 20 Westward Migration (正确率 66.99%) 
   Why were these hundreds of thousands of settlers—most of them farmers, some of them artisans—drawn away from the cleared fields and established cities and villages of the East? Certain characteristics of American society help to explain this remarkable migration. The European ancestors of some Americans had for centuries lived rooted to the same village or piece of land until some religious, political, or economic crisis uprooted them and drove them across the Atlantic. Many of those who experienced this sharp break thereafter lacked the ties that had bound them and their ancestors to a single place. Moreover, European society was relatively stratified; occupation and social status were inherited. In American society, **however**, the class structure was less rigid; <u>some people changed occupations easily【A / C】 and believed it was their duty to improve their social and economic position【B】</u>. As a result, many Americans were an inveterately restless, rootless, and ambitious people. Therefore, these social traits helped to produce the nomadic and daring settlers who kept pushing westward beyond the fringes of settlement. <u>In addition, there were other immigrants who migrated west in search of new homes, material success, and better lives</u>. 

   Q: According to paragraph 2, all of the following are **reasons** why ==Americans migrated westward== EXCEPT

   A.	The desire to **move** from one pace to the next  
   B.	The hope of **improving** their socioeconomic status  
   C.	The opportunity to **change** jobs

   Five centuries later, about 7700 B.C., a new village rose on the mound. At first the inhabitants still <u>hunted gazelle intensively【B】</u>. <u>Then, about 7000 B.C.</u> :star:,​within the space of a few generations, the switched abruptly to <u>herding domesticated goats and sheep【A】</u> and to growing einkorn, pulses, and other cereal grasses. Abu Hureyra grew rapidly until it covered nearly 30 acres. It was a close-knit community of rectangular, one-story mud-brick houses, joined by narrow lanes and courtyards, finally abandoned about 5000 B.C. Many complex factors led to the adoption of the new economies, not only at Abu Hureyra, but at many other locations such as ‘Ain Ghazal, also in Syria, where goat toe bones showing the telltale marks of abrasion caused by foot tethering (binding)’ testify to earl herding of domestic stock. 

   Q: According to paragraph 5, ==after 7000 B.C. the settlement of Abu Hureyra differed from earlier settlements at that location== in all of the following EXCEPT

   <u>Western farmers altered the landscape by reducing the annual fires【A】</u> that had kept the prairie free from trees. In the absence of these fires, <u>trees reappeared on land not in cultivation and, if undisturbed, eventually formed woodlots【C】</u>.

9. :question:TPO 6 Infantile Amnesia (正确率 64.44%)  
   How might this inability to recall early experiences be explained? The sheer passage of time does not account for it; adults have excellent recognition of pictures of people who attended high school with them 35 years earlier. Another seemingly plausible explanation--that <u>infants do not form enduring memories at this point in development-also is incorrect【B】</u>. Children two and a half to three years old remember experiences that occurred in their first year, and eleven month olds remember some events a year later. Nor does the hypothesis that <u>infantile amnesia reflects repression【A】</u>---or <u>holding back—of sexually charged episodes explain the phenomenon【C】</u>. While such repression may occur,people cannot remember ordinary events from the infant and toddler periods either. 

   Q: All of the following theories about ==the inability to recall early experiences are rejected== in paragraph 2 EXCEPT: 

   A.	The ability to recall an event decreases as the time after the event increases.  
   B.	Young children are not capable of forming memories that last for more than a short time.  
   C.	People may hold back sexually meaningful memories.

    Of course, there is far more oil underground than can be recovered. It may <u>be in a pool too small or too far from a potential market【C】</u> to justify the expense of drilling. Some oil lies under <u>regions where drilling is forbidden【A】</u>, such as national parks or other public lands. Even given the best extraction techniques, only about 30 to 40 percent of the oil in a given pool can be brought to the surface. The rest is far too difficult to extract and has to remain underground. 

    Q: According to paragraph 5, ==the decision to drill for oil depends on all of the following factors== EXCEPT

    A.	**permission** to access the area where oil has been found  
    B.	the **availability** of sufficient quantities of oil in a pool

11. TPO 24 Breathing During Sleep (正确率 58.99%)  
    But that is not all that changes. During all phases of sleep, several changes in the air passages have been observed. It takes twice as much effort to breathe during sleep because of greater resistance to airflow in the airways and changes in the efficiency of the muscles used for breathing. <u>Some of the muscles that help keep the upper airway open【C】 when breathing tend to become more relaxed during sleep</u>, especially during REM (the phase of sleep in which there is rapid eye movement). Without this muscular action, inhaling is like sucking air out of a balloon—the narrow passages tend to collapse. Also there is a regular cycle of <u>change in resistance between the two sides of the【B】 nose</u>. If something blocks the ""good"" side, such as congestion from allergies or a cold, then resistance increases dramatically. Coupled with these factors is <u>the loss of the complex interactions【D】 among the muscles that can change the route of airflow from nose to mouth.</u> 

    Q: All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 4 as ==being characteristic of breathing during sleep== EXCEPT 

    A.	relaxation of the muscles involved in the respiratory system

12. TPO 10 Seventeenth-Century European Economic Growth (正确率 56.77%)  
    The rapid expansion in international trade also benefitted from an infusion of capital, stemming largely from gold and silver brought by Spanish vessels from the Americas. This capital financed the production of goods, storage, trade, and even credit across Europe and overseas. Moreover an increased credit supply was generated by investments and loans by bankers and <u>wealthy merchants【C】</u> to states and by joint-stock partnerships - an English innovation (the first major company began in 1600). Unlike <u>short-term financial cooperation between investors【A】</u> for a single commercial undertaking, <u>joint-stock companies【D】</u> provided permanent funding of capital by drawing on the investments of merchants and other investors who purchased shares in the company. 

    Q: According to paragraph 8, each of the following was ==a source of funds used to finance economic expansion== EXCEPT

13. TPO 30 The Invention of the Mechanical Clock (正确率 56.77%)  
    Medieval Europe gave new importance to reliable time. <u>The Catholic Church had its seven daily prayers, one of which was at night, requiring an alarm arrangement to waken monks before dawn.【D】</u> And then the new cities and towns, squeezed by their walls, had to know and order time in order to organize <u>collective activity【B】 and ration space</u>. <u>They set a time to go to sleep【C】</u>. All this was compatible with older devices so long as there was only one authoritative timekeeper; but with urban growth and the multiplication of time signals, discrepancy brought discord and strife. Society needed a more dependable instrument of time measurement and found it in the mechanical clock. 

    According to paragraph 2, all of the following are examples of ==the importance of timekeeping to medieval European society== EXCEPT: 

    A.	the need of different towns to **coordinate timekeeping with each other**  
    B.	the setting of specific times for **the opening and closing of markets**

14. TPO 19 The Roman Army's Impact on Britain (正确率 55.49%)  
    The army also provided a means of personal advancement for auxiliary soldiers recruited from the native peoples, as a man obtained hereditary Roman citizenship on retirement after service in an auxiliary regiment. Such units recruited on an ad hoc (as needed) basis from the area in which they were stationed, and there was evidently large-scale recruitment within Britain. The total numbers were at least 12,500 men up| to the reign of the emperor Hadrian (A.D. 117-138), with a peak around A.D. 80. Although a small proportion of the total population, this perhaps had a massive local impact when a large proportion of the young men were removed from an area. Newly raised regiments were normally transferred to another province from whence it was unlikely that individual recruits would ever return. Most units raised in Britain went elsewhere on the European continent, although one is recorded in Morocco. The reverse process brought young men to Britain, where many continued to live after their 20 to 25 years of since, and this added to the cosmopolitan Roman character of the frontier population. <u>By the later Roman period</u>:star:, <u>frontier garrisons (groups of soldiers) were only **rarely** transferred【C】</u>, since in <u>units became effectively **hereditary**【A】</u>, and <u>forts were **no longer populated**【B】 or maintained at full strength</u>.

15. TPO 21 Autobiographical Memory (正确率 54.58%)  
    A third possibility is that children will not be able to tell their own “life story” until they understand something about the general form stories take, that is, the structure of narratives. Knowledge about narratives arises from social interactions, particularly <u>the storytelling that children experience from parents【B】</u> and <u>the attempts parents make to talk with children about past events in their lives【A】</u>. When parents talk with children about “what we did today” or “last week” or “last year”, they guide the children’s formation of a framework for talking about the past. They also provide children with reminders about the memory and relay the message that <u>memories are valued as part of the cultural experience.【D】</u> It is interesting to note that some studies show Caucasian American children have earlier childhood memories that Korean children do. Furthermore, other studies show that Caucasian American mother-child pairs talk about past events three times more often than do Korean mother-child pairs. Thus, the types of social experiences children have do factor into the development of autobiographical memories. 

    Q: All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 4 as ways in which ==parents help their children understand the structure of narratives== EXCEPT 

    A.	Talking with their children about **past events**  
    B.	**Telling stories** to their children

16. TPO 34 Protection of Plants by Insects (正确率 53%)  
    Extrafloral nectaries at the base of each sepal attract several kinds of insects, but 96 percent of them are ants, several different species of them. When buds are still small, less than a quarter of an inch long, the sepal nectaries are already present and producing nectar. They continue to do so as the flower develops and while the fruit matures. Observations leave little doubt that ants protect morning glory flowers and fruits from the combined enemy force of grasshoppers, caterpillars, and seed beetles. Bentley compares the seed production of six plants that grew where there were no ants with that of seventeen plants that were occupied by ants. Unprotected plants bore only 45 seeds per plant, but plants occupied by ants bore 211 seeds per plant. <u>Although ants are not big enough to kill or seriously injure grasshoppers, they drive them away by nipping at their feet.【A】</u> Seed beetles are more vulnerable because they are much smaller than grasshoppers. <u>The ants prey on the adult beetles【B】</u>, <u>disturb females as they lay their eggs on developing fruits【D】</u>, and <u>eat many of the eggs they do manage to lay【C】</u>. 

    Q: According to paragraph 5, ==ants defend morning glory plants from seed beetles== in each of the following ways EXCEPT 

    A.	driving adult beetles off the plants by nipping at their feet  
    B.	catching and eating adult beetles  
    C.	eating beetle eggs they find on developing fruits

17. :question:TPO 8 Running Water on Mars (正确率 50.73%) 
    Some scientists speculate that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period during which rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans adorned its surface. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what <u>mission specialists think may be a delta【A / B】―a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands.</u> Other researchers go even further, suggesting that the data provide evidence for <u>large open expenses of water on the early Martian surface【D】</u>. A computer- generated view of the Martian North Polar Region shows the extent of what may have been an ancient ocean covering much of the northern lowlands. The Hellas Basin, which measures some 3,000 kilometers across and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the basin’s rim, is another candidate for an ancient Martian sea. 

    Q: All of the following questions about ==geological features on Mars== are answered in paragraph 3 EXCEPT: 

    A.	What are some regions of Mars that may have once been covered with an ocean?  
    B.	Where do mission scientists believe that the river forming the delta emptied?

18. :question:TPO 8 Running Water on Mars (正确率 50.09%)  
    Outflow channels are probably relics of catastrophic flooding on Mars long ago. <u>They appear only in equatorial regions【B】</u> and generally do not form extensive interconnected networks. Instead, they are probably the paths taken by huge volumes of water draining from the southern highlands into the northern plains. <u>The onrushing water arising from these flash floods likely also formed the odd teardrop-shaped “islands” (resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide)【C】</u> that have been found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow channels. Judging from the width and depth of the channels, the flow rates must have been truly enormous―perhaps as much as a hundred times greater than the 105 tons per second carried by the great Amazon River. Flooding shaped the outflow channels approximately 3 billion years ago, <u>about the same times as the northern volcanic plains formed.【A】</u> 

    Q: According to paragraph 2, all of the following are true of ==the outflow channels on Mars== EXCEPT: 

    A.	They formed at around the **same** time that volcanic activity was occurring on the northern plains.
    B.	They are found **only** on certain parts of the Martian surface.  
    C.	They sometimes empty onto what appear to have once been the wet sands of tidal  beaches.

19. TPO 12 Which Hand Did They Use? (正确率 43.75%) 
    We all know that many more people today are right-handed than left-handed. Can one trace this same pattern far back in prehistory? Much of the evidence about right-hand versus left- hand dominance comes from stencils and prints found in rock shelters in Australia and elsewhere, and in many Ice Age caves in France, Spain, and Tasmania. When a left hand has been stenciled, this implies that the artist was right-handed, and vice versa. Even though the paint was often sprayed on by mouth, one can assume that the dominant hand assisted in the operation. One also has to make the assumption that hands were stenciled palm downward— <u>a left hand stenciled palm upward might of course look as if it were a right hand【B】</u>. Of 158 stencils in the French cave of Gargas, 136 have been identified as left, and only 22 as right; right- handedness was therefore heavily predominant. 
    Cave art furnishes other types of evidence of this phenomenon. Most engravings, for example, <u>are best lit from the left【A】</u>, as befits the work of right-handed artists, who generally prefer to have the light source on the left so that the shadow of their hand does not fall on the tip of the engraving tool or brush. <u>In the few cases where an Ice Age figure is depicted holding something, it is mostly, though not always, in the right【D】 hand</u>. 

    All of the following are mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 as evidence of ==right-handedness in art and artists== EXCEPT 

    A.	the ideal source of **lighting** for most engravings  
    B.	the fact that a left hand stenciled palm upward might look like a right hand

20. TPO 14 Pastoralism in Ancient Inner Eurasia (正确率 39.37%)  
    Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to strict rules of portability. If you are constantly on the move, you cannot afford to accumulate large material surpluses. Such rules limit variations in accumulated material goods between pastoralist households (though they may also encourage a taste for portable goods of high value such as silks or jewelry). So, by and large, nomadism implies a high degree of self-sufficiency and inhibits the appearance of an extensive division of labor. <u>Inequalities of wealth and rank certainly exist, and have **probably** existed in most pastoralist societies【A】</u>, but <u>**except** in periods of military conquest【B】, they are normally **too slight to** generate the stable, hereditary hierarchies that are usually implied by the use of the term class【D】</u>. Inequalities of gender have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they seem to have been softened by the absence of steep hierarchies of wealth in most communities, and also by the requirement that women acquire most of the skills of men, including, often, their military skills. 

    Q: According to paragraph 4, all of the following are true of ==social inequality in pastoralist societies== EXCEPT: 

    A.	It exists and has existed **to some degree** in most pastoral societies. 
    B.	It is **most marked** during periods of military conquest.
