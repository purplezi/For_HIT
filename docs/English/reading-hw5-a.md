1. TPO 4 Petroleum Resources (正确率 68.54%) 
        
    <u>Petroleum, **consisting of** crude oil and natural gas, seems to originate from organic matter in marine sediment</u>:star:. Microscopic organisms settle to the seafloor and accumulate in marine mud. The organic matter may partially decompose, using up the dissolved oxygen in the sediment. As soon as the oxygen is gone, decay stops and the remaining organic matter is preserved. 
        
    :grey_question: According to paragraph 1, which of the following is **true** about ==petroleum formation==? 
    
    A.Microscopic organisms that live in mud produce crude oil and natural gas.
    
    B.Large amounts of oxygen are needed for petroleum formation to begin.
    
    C.Petroleum is produced when organic material in sediments combines with decaying marine organisms.
    
    D.Petroleum formation appears to begin in marine sediments where organic matter is present.

2. TPO 8 Running Water on Mars (正确率 68.41%)
   
    Some scientists speculate that Mars may have enjoyed an extended early Period during which rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans adorned its surface. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows what mission specialists think may be a delta―a fan-shaped network of channels and sediments where a river once flowed into a larger body of water, in this case a lake filling a crater in the southern highlands. <u>Other researchers go even further, suggesting that the data provide evidence for large open expenses of water on the early Martian surface.</u>:star: <u>A computer- generated view of the Martian North Polar Region shows the extent of what may have been an ancient ocean **covering** much of the northern lowlands.</u> The Hellas Basin, which measures some 3,000 kilometers across and has a floor that lies nearly 9 kilometers below the basin’s rim, is another candidate for an ancient Martian sea. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 3, ==images of Mars’ surface have been interpreted as support== **for** the idea that 

    A.the polar regions of Mars were once more extensive than they are now

    B.a large part of the northern lowlands may once have been under water 

    C.deltas were once a common feature of the Martian landscape

3. TPO 28 Buck Rubs and Buck Scrapes (正确率 68.16%) 

    <u>Forehead rubbing **by male deer on buck rubs** presumably sends a great deal of information to other members of **the same species**【A】.</u> First… Because both sexes of white-tailed respond to buck rubs by smelling and licking them, rubs may serve a very important additional function. Fresher buck rubs (less than two days old), in particular, are visited more frequently by adult females than older rubs. In view of this behavior it has been suggested that chemicals present in fresh buck rubs may help physiologically induce and synchronize fertility in females that visit these rubs. This would be an obvious advantage to wide-ranging deer, especially to a socially dominant buck when courting several adult females during the autumn rut. Another visual signal produced by while- tailed deer is termed **a buck scrape**. Scrapes consist of a clearing (about 0.5 meter in diameter) and shallow depression made by pushing aside the leaves covering the ground; after making the scrape, the deer typically urinates in the depression. <u>Thus, like a buck rub, a scrape is **both** a visual and an olfactory signal【B】</u>. Buck scrapes are generally created after leaf-fall in autumn, <u>which is just before or during the rut【C】</u>. Scrapes are usually placed in open or conspicuous places, such as along a deer trail. <u>Most are made by older males, although females and younger males (2.5 years old or less) occasionally make scrapes.【A】</u>

    :grey_question: According to the passage, **in what way** do ==buck scrapes differ from buck rubs==?

    A.Buck scrapes are made by both male and female deer. 

    B.Buck scrapes are purely visual signals 

    C.Buck scrapes are made closer to the breeding season than buck rub

    D.Buck scrapes can be smelled only by deer

4. TPO 21 The Origins of Agriculture (正确率 68.05%) 

    Climatic changes at the end of the glacial period 13, 000 years ago have been proposed to account for the emergence of farming. The temperature increased dramatically in a short period of time (years rather than centuries), allowing for a growth of the hunting-gathering population due to the abundance of resources. <u>There were, however, fluctuations in the **climatic conditions**, with the consequences that **wet conditions** were followed by **dry ones**, so that the availability of plants and animals oscillated brusquely</u>:star:

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 3, ==the abundance of resources fluctuated sharply after the end of the glacial period== **because**

    A.Locally abundant resources were quickly exhausted by hunter-gatherers

    B.The temperature became much higher in some areas over others

    C.Different types of plants and animals became available as the climate changed 

    D.The amount of rainfall varied radically from one period to the next.

5. :exclamation:TPO 23 Seventeenth-Century Dutch Agriculture (正确率 68%) 

    As the demand for agricultural produce from both consumers and industry increased, agricultural land became more valuable and people tried to work the available land more intensively and to reclaim more land from wetlands and lakes. <u>In order to increase production on existing land, the peasants made more use of crop rotation and, in particular, began to apply animal waste to the soil regularly, rather than leaving the fertilization process up to the grazing livestock.</u> :star:For the first time industrial waste, such as ash from the soap-boilers, was collected in the cities and sold in the country as artificial fertilizer. The increased yield and price of land justified reclaiming and draining even more land. 

    :grey_question: Select the TWO answer choices that, according to paragraph 4, indicate **two methods** ==people used to increase the productivity of their land==. To receive credit you must select TWO answers 

    A.They planted different crops in different sections of the farm each year. 

    B.They used improved irrigation methods to increase the yield of crops. 

    C.They increased the use of fertilizers to supply more nutrients to plants.

6. TPO 15 Mass Extinction (正确率 67.94%) 

    <u>One interesting test of the Alvarez hypothesis is based on the presence of the rare-earth element iridium (Ir).</u>:star: <u>Earth’s crust contains very **little** of this element, but most asteroids contain **a lot more**</u>. Debris thrown into the atmosphere by an asteroid collision would presumably contain large amounts of iridium, and atmospheric currents would carry this material all over the globe. A search of sedimentary deposits that span the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods shows that there is a dramatic increase in the abundance of iridium briefly and precisely at this boundary. This iridium anomaly offers strong support for the Alvarez hypothesis even though no asteroid itself has ever been recovered.

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 6, **what** made ==iridium a useful test of the Alvarez hypothesis==?

    A.Its occurrence in a few locations on Earth against several locations on other planets

    B.Its occurrence in limited quantities on Earth against its abundance in asteroids

    C.Its ability to remain solid at extremely high temperatures

    D.Its ease of detection even in very small amounts

7. TPO 10 Seventeenth-Century European Economic Growth (正确率 67.89%) 

    <u>Increased agricultural production in turn facilitated rural industry, an intrinsic part of the expansion of industry</u>:star:. Woolens and textile manufacturers, in particular, utilized rural cottage (in-home) production, which took advantage of cheap and plentiful rural labor. In the German states, the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) further moved textile production into the countryside. Members of poor peasant families spun or wove cloth and linens at home for scant remuneration in an attempt to supplement meager family income. 

    :grey_question: Paragraph 4 supports the idea that ==increased agricultural production was important for the expansion of industry primarily== **because** it. 

    A.increased the number of available workers in rural areas 

    B.provided new types of raw materials for use by industry 

    C.resulted in an improvement in the health of the rural cottage workers used by manufacturers 

    D.helped repair some of the ravages of the Thirty Years’ War

8. TPO 11 Ancient Egyptian Sculpture (正确率 67.66%) 

    Statues were normally made of stone, wood, or metal. Stone statues were worked from single rectangular blocks of material and retained the compactness of the original shape. The stone between the arms and the body and between the legs in standing figures or the legs and the seat in seated ones was not normally cut away. From a practical aspect this protected the figures against breakage and psychologically gives the images a sense of strength and power, usually enhanced by a supporting back pillar. <u>By contrast, wooden statues were carved from **several pieces of wood**【B】 that were pegged together to form the finished work</u>, and metal statues were either made by wrapping sheet metal around a wooden core or cast by the lost wax process. The arms could be held away from the body and carry separate items in their hands; there is no back pillar. The effect is altogether lighter and freer than that achieved in stone, but because both perform the same function, formal wooden and metal statues still display frontality. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 3, which of the following statements about ==wooden statues== is **true**? 

    A.Wooden statues were usually larger than stone statues. 

    B.Wooden statues were made from a single piece of wood. 

    C.Wooden statues contained pieces of metal or stone attached to the front. 

    D.Wooden statues had a different effect on the viewer than stone statues.

9. :exclamation:TPO 28 Early Saharan Pastoralists (正确率 67.39%) 

    Even before the drought, the Sahara was never well watered. Both humans and animals were constantly on the move, in search of food and reliable water supplies. Under these circumstances, archaeologist Andrew Smith believes, <u>the small herd of Bos primigenius in the desert became smaller, more closely knit breeding units as the drought took hold. :star:**The beasts** were more disciplined, so that it was **easier** for hunters to predict their habits【D】, and capture animals at will【B】</u>. At the same time, both cattle and humans were more confined in their movements, staying much closer to permanent water supplies for long periods of time. As a result, cattle and humans came into close association.

    :grey_question: Paragraph 2 **supports** which of the following ideas about ==wild oxen in the Sahara region after the drought took hold==? 

    A.They traveled in smaller herds. 

    B.They were harder for hunters to capture. 

    C.They tended to be significantly smaller in size. 

    D.They moved along less predictable routes.

10. TPO 19 Succession, Climax, and Ecosystems (正确率 67.37%) 

    Clements and other early ecologists saw almost lawlike regularity in the order of succession, but that has not been substantiated. A general trend can be recognized, but the details are usually unpredictable. <u>Succession is influenced by many factors: the nature of the soil, exposure to sun and wind, regularity of precipitation, change colonizations, and many other random processes.</u> 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 2, which of the following **is** ==a criticism of Clements “view of succession”==? 

    A.The principles of succession are more lawlike than Clements thought they were. 

    B.More evidence is needed to establish Clements' predictions about succession. 

    C.The details of succession are affected by random processes. 

    D.Many of the factors that determine which plants will grow in an environment, such as the nature of the soil and the exposure to sun, do not change at all.

11. :exclamation:TPO 20 Fossil Preservation (正确率 67.21%) 

    <u>Many other processes may **alter** the shell of the clam or snail and enhance its chances for preservation</u>:star:. Water containing dissolved silica, calcium carbonate, or iron may circulate through the enclosing sediment and be deposited in cavities such as narrow cavities and canals in bone once occupied by blood vessels and nerves. In such cases, the original composition of the bone or shell remains, but the fossil is made harder and more durable. <u>This addition of a chemically precipitated substance into precipitated is termed “permineralization.”</u> 

    :grey_question: Which of the following **best explains** ==the process of permineralization== mentioned in paragraph 3？ 

    A. Water containing calcium carbonate circulates through a shell and deposits sediment.

    B.Liquid containing chemicals hardens an already existing fossil structure. 

    C.Water passes through sediment surrounding a fossil and removes its chemical content.

    D.A chemical substance enters a fossil and changes its shape.

12. TPO 6 Infantile Amnesia (正确率 67.19%) 

    A second explanation involves the influence of the social world on children’s language use.<u>Hearing and telling stories about events may help children store information in ways that will endure into later childhood and adulthood.</u> <u>Through hearing stories with a clear beginning, middle, and ending children may learn to extract the gist of events in ways that they will be able to describe many years later.</u>:star:Consistent with this view parents and children increasingly engage in discussions of past events when children are about three years old. However, hearing such stories is not sufficient for younger children to form enduring memories. Telling such stories to two year olds does not seem to produce long-lasting verbalizable memories. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 4, **what role** may ==storytelling play in forming childhood memories==? 

    A.It may encourage the physiological maturing of the brain. 

    B.It may help preschool children tell the difference between ordinary and unusual memories. 

    C.It may help preschool children retrieve memories quickly. 

    D.It may provide an ordered structure that facilitates memory retrieval.

13. TPO 22 Spartina (正确率 66.95%) 

    These characteristics make Spartina a valuable component of the estuaries where it occurs naturally. The plant functions as a stabilizer and a sediment trap and as a nursery area for estuarine fish and shellfish. Once established, a stand of Spartina begins to trap sediment, <u>changing the substrate elevation【B】,</u> and eventually the stand evolves into a high marsh system where Spartina is gradually <u>displaced by higher-elevation, brackish-water species【B/C】</u>. As elevation increases, narrow, deep channels of water form throughout the marsh. <u>Along the east coast Spartina is considered valuable for its ability to prevent erosion and marshland deterioration; it is also used for coastal restoration projects and the creation of new wetland sites.</u> :star:

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 4, ==in its natural habitats, Spartina helps estuaries== **by** 

    A. controlling marshland decline 

    B. decreasing the substrate elevation

14. .TPO 27 The Formation of Volcanic Islands (正确率 66.4%) 

    The oceanic volcanic islands and their hot-spot trails are thus especially useful for geologists because they record the past locations of the plate over a fixed source. They therefore permit the reconstruction of the process of seafloor spreading, and consequently of the geography of continents and of ocean basins in the past. For example, given the current position of the Pacific Plate, Hawaii is above the Pacific Ocean hot spot. So the position of the Pacific Plate 50 million years ago can be determined by moving it such that a 50-million-year-old volcano in the hot-spot trail (sits at the location of Hawaii today). <u>However, **because** the ocean basins really are short-lived features on geologic times scales, reconstructing the world’s geography by backtracking along the hot-spot trail **works only for** the last 5 percent or so of geologic time</u>. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 5, **why** are ==geologists unable to trace back the entire geologic of continents from hot-spot trails==? 

    A.Hot spots have existed for only about 5 percent of geologic time 

    B.Hawaii did not exist 50 million years ago 

    C.Oceanic basins that contained old hot-spot trails disappeared a long time ago 

    D.Hot-spot trails can be reconstructed only for island chains

15. :exclamation:TPO 4 Petroleum Resources (正确率 66.39%) 

    <u>As oil becomes increasingly difficult to find, the search for it is extended into more-hostile environments</u>. The development of the oil field on the North Slope of Alaska and the construction of the Alaska pipeline are examples of the great expense and difficulty involved in new oil discoveries. Offshore drilling platforms extend the search for oil to the ocean's continental shelves—those gently sloping submarine regions at the edges of the continents. More than one-quarter of the world's oil and almost one-fifth of the world's natural gas come from offshore, even though offshore drilling is six to seven times more expensive than drilling on land. A significant part of this oil and gas comes from under the North Sea between Great Britain and Norway. Of course, there is far more oil underground than can be recovered. It may be in a pool too small or too far from a potential market to justify the expense of drilling. Some oil lies under regions where drilling is forbidden, such as national parks or other public lands. Even given the best extraction techniques, only about 30 to 40 percent of the oil in a given pool can be brought to the surface. The rest is far too difficult to extract and has to remain underground. 

    :grey_question: **Which** of the following **strategies** for ==oil exploration== is describe in paragraph 4?

    A.Drilling under the ocean’s surface 

    B.Limiting drilling to accessible locations 

    C.Using highly sophisticated drilling equipment

16. TPO 11 Begging by Nestlings (正确率66.36%) 

    Further evidence for the costs of begging comes from a study of differences in the begging calls of warbler species that nest on the ground versus those that nest in the relative safety of trees. The young of ground-nesting warblers produce begging cheeps of higher frequencies than do their tree-nesting relatives. <u>These higher-frequency sounds do not travel as far, and so may better **conceal** the individuals producing them, who are especially **vulnerable** to predators in their ground nests.</u>:star: David Haskell created artificial nests with clay eggs and placed them on the ground beside a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree-nesting or of ground-nesting warblers. The eggs “advertised” by the treenesters' begging calls were found bitten significantly more often than the eggs associated with the ground-nesters' calls. 

    :grey_question: ==The experiment described in paragraph 2 supports== **which** of the following **conclusions**? 

    A.Predators are unable to distinguish between the begging cheeps of ground-nesting and those of treenesting warblers except by the differing frequencies of the calls. 

    B.When they can find them, predators prefer the eggs of tree-nesting warblers to those of groundnesting warblers. 

    C.The higher frequencies of the begging cheeps of ground-nesting warblers are an adaptation to the threat that ground-nesting birds face from predators 

    D.The danger of begging depends more on the frequency of the begging cheep than on how loud it is.

17. TPO 13 Methods of Studying Infant Perception (正确率66.25%) 

    Two additional techniques of studying infant perception have come into vogue. The first is the habituation-dishabituation technique, in which a single stimulus is presented repeatedly to the infant until there is a measurable decline (habituation) in whatever attending behavior is being observed. At that point a new stimulus is presented, and any recovery (dishabituation) in responsiveness is recorded. If the infant fails to dishabituate and continues to show habituation with the new stimulus, it is assumed that the baby is unable to perceive the new stimulus as different. The habituation-dishabituation paradigm has been used most extensively with studies of auditory and olfactory perception in infants. The second technique relies on evoked potentials, which are electrical brain responses that may be related to a particular stimulus because of where they originate. <u>Changes in the electrical pattern of the brain indicate that the stimulus is getting through to the infant's central nervous system and eliciting some form of response.</u> 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 4, which of the following **leads to the conclusion** that ==infants are able to differentiate between stimuli in a habituation dishabituation study==?

    A.Dishabituation occurs with the introduction of a new stimulus. 

    B.Electrical responses in the infant's brain decline with each new stimulus. 

    C.Habituation is continued with the introduction of a new stimulus. 

    D.The infant displays little change in electrical brain responses.

18. TPO 23 Seventeenth-Century Dutch Agriculture (正确率 66.12%) 

    The Dutch battle against the sea is legendary. Noorderkwartier in Holland, with its numerous lakes and stretches of water, was particularly suitable for land reclamation and one of the biggest projects undertaken there was the draining of the Beemster lake which began in 1608. <u>The richest merchants in Amsterdam contributed money to reclaim a good 7,100 hectares of land.【B】</u> F<u>orty-three windmills powered the drainage pumps【A】</u> so that they were able to lease the reclamation to farmers as early as 1612, <u>with the investors receiving annual leasing payments at an interest rate of 17 percent.【C】</u> Land reclamation continued, and between 1590 and 1665, almost 100,000 hectares were reclaimed from the wetland areas of Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland. However, land reclamation decreased significantly after the middle of the seventeenth century because the price of agricultural products began to fall, making land reclamation far less profitable in the second part of the century. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 5, which of the following was an important reason **why** ==land- reclamation projects in the first half of the seventeenth century proceeded rapidly==? 

    A. Windmills became powerful enough to run drainage pumps efficiently. 

    B. Merchants invested large amounts of money in reclamation. 

    C. High interest rates discouraged people from buying land already available. 

    D. Reclaimed land was much more suitable for agriculture than the existing land.

19. TPO 16 Trade and the Ancient Middle East (正确率 65.54%) 

    Reliance on trade had several important consequences. Production was generally in the hands of skilled individual artisans doing piecework under the tutelage of a master who was also the shop owner. <u>In these shops differences of rank were **blurred** as artisans and masters labored side by side in the same modest establishment【A】</u>, were usually members of the same guild and religious sect, lived in the same neighborhoods, and often had assumed (or real) kinship relationships. <u>The worker was bound to the master by a mutual contract that either one could **repudiate**, and the relationship was conceptualized as one of partnership.</u> :star:

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 2, **how** did ==Middle Eastern shop owners treat their workers==?

    A.Workers were ranked according to their skill level, with the most-experienced Artisans becoming partial owners of the shop 

    B.Shop owners treated different workers differently depending on how much the workers had in common with their masters. 

    C.Workers were bound to their masters by unbreakable contracts that strictly defined the terms of their partnership.

20. TPO 29 The History of Waterpower (正确率 65.51%) 

    The earliest waterpower mills were probably vertical-axis mills for grinding corn, known as Norse or Greek mills, which seem to have appeared during the first or second century B.C. in the Middle East and a few centuries later in Scandinavia. <u>In the following centuries, **increasingly sophisticated** waterpower mills were built throughout the Roman Empire and beyond its boundaries in the Middle East and northern Europe.</u>:star: In England, the Saxons are thought to have used both horizontal-and verticalaxis wheels. The first documented English mill was in the eighth century, but three centuries later about 5,000 were recorded, suggesting that every settlement of any size had its mill. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 2, what was **true** of ==the waterpower mills built throughout the Roman Empire==? 

    A.Most had horizontal-axis wheels 

    B.Their design was based on mills that had long been used in Scandinavia

22. TPO 29 Competition (正确率 65.34%) 

    To what extent competition **determines** the composition of a community and the density of particular species has been the source of considerable controversy. The problem is that competition ordinarily cannot be observed directly but must be inferred from the spread or increase of one species and the concurrent reduction or disappearance of another species. <u>The Russian biologist G.F. Gause performed numerous two-species became extinct when only a single kind of resource was available. On the basis of these experiments and of field observations, the so-called law of competitive exclusion was formulated, according to which no two species can occupy the same niche.</u> :star:Numerous seeming exceptions to this law have since been found, but they can usually be explained as cases in which the two species, even though competing for a major joint resource, did not really occupy exactly the same niche. 

    :grey_question: Paragraph 3 supports the idea that ==Gause's experiments were important== **because** they

    A.provided a situation in which competition could be removed from the interaction between two species

    B.showed that previous ideas about the extent to which competition determines the composition of a community were completely mistaken

    Early in his research, Kramer found that <u>caged migratory birds became very restless at about the time they would normally have begun migration in the wild.</u>:star: Furthermore, he noticed that as they fluttered around in the cage, they often launched themselves in the direction of their normal migratory route. He then set up experiments with caged starlings and found that their orientation was, in fact, in the proper migratory direction except when the sky was overcast, at which times there was no clear direction to their restless movements. Kramer surmised, therefore, that they were orienting according to the position of the Sun. To test this idea, he blocked their view of the Sun and used mirrors to change its apparent position. He found that under these circumstances, the birds oriented with respect to the new “Sun”. They seemed to be using the Sun as a compass to determine direction. At the time, this idea seemed preposterous. How could a bird navigate by the Sun when some of us lose our way with road maps? Obviously, more testing was in order. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 3, **when** do ==caged starlings become restless==? 

    A.When the weather is overcast 

    B.When they are unable to identify their normal migratory route 

    C.When their normal time for migration arrives 

    D.When mirrors are used to change the apparent position of the Sun

24. TPO 18Lightning (正确率 64.14%) 

    The separation of charged particles that forms in a storm cloud has a sandwich-like structure. Concentrations of positively charged particles develop at the top and bottom of the cloud, but the middle region becomes negatively charged. Recent measurements made in the field together with laboratory simulations offer a promising explanation of how this structure of charged particles forms. What happens is that small (millimeter-to centimeter-size) pellets of ice form in the cold upper regions of the cloud. When these ice pellets fall, some of them strike much smaller ice crystals in the center of the cloud. The temperature at the center of the cloud is about -15°C or lower. At such temperatures, the collision between the ice pellets and the ice crystals causes electrical charges to shift so that the ice pellets acquire a negative charge and the ice crystals become positively charged. Then updraft wind currents carry the light, positively charged ice crystals up to the top of the cloud. The heavier negatively charged ice pellets are left to concentrate in the center. This process explains why the top of the cloud becomes positively charged, while the center becomes negatively charged. The negatively charged region is large: several hundred meters thick and several kilometers in diameter. <u>Below this large, cold, negatively charged region, the cloud is warmer than -15°C:star:, and at these temperatures, collisions between ice crystals and falling ice pellets produce positively charged ice pellets that then populate a small region at the base of the cloud</u>. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 2, **why** are ==positively charged ice pellets produced in the lower part of the cloud==? 

    A.Collisions between ice crystals and ice pellets increase in number in the lower part of the cloud 

    B.The lower part of the cloud is smaller than the region above it 

    C.More ice pellets than ice crystals reach the lower part of the cloud

25. TPO 10 Variations in the Climate (正确率 64.12%) 

    Over long periods of time, substances whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time can be deposited in a systematic way to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years. Generally, the layering occurs on an annual basis, hence the observed changes in the records can be dated. Information on temperature, rainfall, and other aspects of the climate that can be inferred from the systematic changes in properties is usually referred to as proxy data. <u>Proxy temperature records have been reconstructed **from** ice core drilled out of the central Greenland ice cap, calcite shells embedded in layered lake sediments in Western Europe, ocean floor sediment cores from the tropical Atlantic Ocean, ice cores from Peruvian glaciers, and ice cores from eastern Antarctica</u>. While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur on a global scale, there are nonetheless some intriguing differences, which suggest that the pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other. 

    According to paragraph 3, ==scientists are able to reconstruct proxy temperature records== **by**

    A.studying regional differences in temperature variations 

    B.studying and dating changes in the properties of substances

27. TPO 2 The Origins of Cetaceans (正确率 63.93%) 

    It should be obvious that cetaceans-whales, porpoises, and dolphins-are mammals. They breathe through lungs, not through gills, and give birth to live young. Their streamlined bodies, the absence of hind legs, and <u>the presence of a fluke and blowhole **cannot disguise** their affinities with land dwelling mammals.</u> However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses, whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record. How was the gap between a walking mammal and a swimming whale bridged? Missing until recently were fossils clearly intermediate, or transitional, between land mammals and cetaceans.

    Most savannas probably experience mild fires frequently and major burns every two years or so. <u>Many savanna and dry-forest plant species are called pyrophytes, meaning they are adapted in various ways to **withstand** occasional burning【C】.</u> Frequent fire is a factor to which rain forest species seem unable to adapt, although ancient charcoal remains from Amazon forest soils dating prior to the arrival of humans suggest that moist forests also occasionally burn. Experiments suggest that if fire did not occur in savannas in the Americas, species composition would change significantly. <u>When burning occurs, it prevents competition among plant species from progressing to the point where some species exclude others, reducing the overall diversity of the ecosystem【B / D】</u>.:star: But in experimental areas protected from fire, a few perennial grass species eventually come to dominate, outcompeting all others.

29. TPO19 Discovering the Ice Ages(正确率 63.75%) 

    <u>In the middle of the nineteenth century【A】</u>, Louis Agassiz, one of the first scientists to study glaciers, immigrated to the United States from Switzerland and became a professor at Harvard University, where he continued his studies in geology and other sciences. For his research, Agassiz visited many places in the northern parts of Europe and North America, from the mountains of Scandinavia and New England to the rolling hills of the American Midwest. In all these diverse regions, Agassiz saw signs of glacial erosion and sedimentation. In flat plains country, he saw moraines (accumulations of earth and loose rock that form at the edges of glaciers) that reminded him of the terminal moraines found at the end of valley glaciers in the Alps. The heterogeneous material of the drift (sand, clay, and rocks deposited there) convinced him of its glacial origin. The areas covered by this material were so vast that the ice that deposited it must have been a continental glacier larger than Greenland or Antarctica. Eventually, Agassiz and others convinced geologists and the general public that a great continental glaciation had extended the polar ice caps far into regions that now enjoy temperate climates. For the first time, people began to talk about ice ages. It was also apparent that the glaciation occurred in the relatively recent past because the drift was soft, like freshly deposited sediment. We now know the age of the glaciation accurately from radiometric dating of the carbon-14 in logs buried in the drift. The drift of the last glaciation was deposited during one of the most recent epochs of geologic time, the Pleistocene, which lasted from 1.8 million to 10,000 years ago. Along the east coast of the United States, the southernmost advance of this ice is recorded by the enormous sand and drift deposits of the terminal moraines that form Long Island and Cape Cod. 

    It soon became clear that :star:<u>there were multiple glacial ages during the Pleistocene, with warmer interglacial intervals between them</u>. <u>As geologists mapped glacial deposits in the late nineteenth century, they became aware that there were several layers of drift, the lower ones corresponding to earlier ice ages.</u> Between the older layers of glacial material were well- developed soils containing fossils of warmclimate plants. These soils were evidence that the glaciers retreated as the climate warmed. <u>By the early part of the twentieth century【C】</u>, scientists believed that four distinct glaciations had affected North America and Europe during the Pleistocene epoch. 

    <u>This idea was modified in the late twentieth century【D】</u>, when geologists and oceanographers examining oceanic sediment found fossil evidence of warming and cooling of the oceans. Ocean sediments presented a much more complete geologic record of the Pleistocene than continental glacial deposits did. The fossils buried in Pleistocene and earlier ocean sediments were of foraminifera—small, singlecelled marine organisms that secrete shells of calcium carbonate, or calcite. These shells differ in their proportion of ordinary oxygen (oxygen-16) and the heavy oxygen isotope (oxygen-18). The ratio of oxygen-16 to oxygen-18 found in the calcite of a foraminifer's shell depends on the temperature of the water in which the organism lived. Different ratios in the shells preserved in various layers of sediment reveal the temperature changes in the oceans during the Pleistocene epoch. 

    Isotopic analysis of shells allowed geologists to measure another glacial effect. They could trace the growth and shrinkage of continental glaciers, even in parts of the ocean where there may have been no great change in temperature—around the equator, for example. The oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice. During glaciations, the lighter oxygen-16 has a greater tendency to evaporate from the ocean surface than the heavier oxygen-18 does. Thus, more of the heavy isotope is left behind in the ocean and absorbed by marine organisms. From this analysis of marine sediments, geologists have learned that there were many shorter, more regular cycles of glaciation and deglaciation than geologists had recognized from the glacial drift of the continents alone. 

    :grey_question: According to the passage, **when** did ==scientists begin to realize that more than one ice age had occurred==?

32. TPO 4 Cave Art in Europe (正确率 63.16%) 

    The particular symbolic significance of the cave paintings in southwestern France is more explicitly revealed, perhaps, by the results of a study conducted by researchers Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson. The data they present suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as hides. For example, wild cattle (bovines) and horses are portrayed more often than we would expect by chance, probably because they were larger and heavier (meatier) than other animals in the environment. In addition, the paintings mostly portray animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size, speed, natural weapons such as tusks and horns, and the unpredictability of their behavior. That is, mammoths, bovines, and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer. <u>Thus, the paintings are consistent with the idea that the art is related to the importance of hunting in the economy of Upper Paleolithic people.:star: Consistent with this idea, according to the investigators, is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper Paleolithic **also seems** to reflect how people got their food【B】.</u> But in that period, when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game animals (because they were becoming extinct), <u>the art **ceased** to focus on portrayals of animals.【C】</u>

    Although southem Maya areas received more rainfall than northern areas, problems of water were paradoxically more severe in the wet south. While that made things hard for ancient Maya living in the south, it has also made things hard for modem archaeologists who have difficulty understanding why ancient droughts caused bigger problems in the wet south than in the dry north. <u>The likely explanation is that an area of underground freshwater underlies the Yucatan Peninsula, but surface elevation increases from north to south, so that as one moves south the land surface lies increasingly higher above the water table.【D】</u> In the northern peninsula the elevation is sufficiently low that the ancient Maya were able to reach the water table at deep sinkholes called cenotes, or at deep caves. In low-elevation north coastal areas without sinkholes, the Maya would have been able to get down to the water table by digging wells up to 75 feet (22 meters) deep.

43. TPO 1 Timberline Vegetation on Mountains (正确率 59.06%) 

    At the upper timberline the trees begin to become twisted and deformed. This is particularly true for trees in the middle and upper latitudes, which tend to attain greater heights on ridges, whereas in the tropics the trees reach their greater heights in the valleys. <u>This is because middle- and upper- latitude timberlines are strongly influenced by the duration and depth of the snow cover【A】</u>. As the snow is deeper and lasts longer in the valleys, <u>trees tend to attain greater heights on the ridges, **even though** they are **more** exposed to high-velocity winds【C】 and poor, thin soils there.</u> In the tropics, the valleys appear to be more favorable because they are less prone to dry out, they have less frost, and they have deeper soils. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 3, which of the following is true of ==trees in the middle and upper latitudes==?

    A third likely explanation for infantile amnesia involves incompatibilities between the ways in which infants encode information and the ways in which older children and adults retrieve it. Whether people can remember an event depends critically on the fit between the way in which they earlier encoded the information and the way in which they later attempt to retrieve it. The better able the person is to reconstruct the perspective from which the material was encoded, the more likely that recall will be successful. This view is supported by a variety of factors that can create <u>mismatches between very young children's encoding and older children's and adults' retrieval efforts</u>. The world looks very different to a person whose head is only two or three feet above the ground than to one whose head is five or six feet above it, older children and adults often try to retrieve the names of things they saw, but <u>infants would not have encoded the information verbally.</u> General knowledge of categories of events such as a birthday party or a visit to the doctor's office helps older individuals encode their experiences, but again, infants and toddlers are unlikely to encode many experiences within such knowledge structures.

45. TPO 23 Rock Art of the Australia Aborigines (正确率 58.18%)

    In the 1970s when the study of Australian archaeology was in an exciting phase of development, with the great antiquity of rock art becoming clear. Lesley Maynard, the archaeologist who coined the phrase “Panaramitee style,” suggested that a sequence could be determined for Australian rock art, in which a geometric style gave way to a simple figurative style (outlines of figures and animals),:star: <u>followed by a range of complex figurative styles that, unlike the pan-Australian geometric tradition tended to much **greater regional diversity**.</u> While accepting that this sequence fits the archaeological profile of those sites, which were occupied continuously over many thousands of years a number of writers have warned that the underlying assumption of such a sequence—a development from the simple and the geometric to the complex and naturalistic—obscures the cultural continuities in Aboriginal Australia, in which geometric symbolism remains fundamentally important. In this context the simplicity of a geometric motif may be more apparent than real. Motifs of seeming simplicity can encode complex meanings in Aboriginal Australia. And has not twentieth-century art shown that naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction in some kind of predetermine sequence? 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 5, ==the complex figurative style differs from the geometric style in that the complex figurative style==

46. :question:TPO 14 Pastoralism in Ancient Inner Eurasia (正确率 57.59%) 

    Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to ==strict rules of portability==. If you are constantly on the move, you cannot afford to accumulate large material surpluses. Such rules limit variations in accumulated material goods between pastoralist households (though they may also encourage a taste for portable goods of high value such as silks or jewelry). So, by and large, <u>nomadism implies a high degree of self-sufficiency and inhibits the appearance of an extensive division of labor</u>. Inequalities of wealth and rank certainly exist, and have probably existed in most pastoralist societies, but except in periods of military conquest, they are normally too slight to generate the stable, hereditary hierarchies that are usually implied by the use of the term class. Inequalities of gender have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they seem to have been softened by the absence of steep hierarchies of wealth in most communities, and also by the requirement that women acquire most of the skills of men, including, often, their military skills. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 4, the fact that ==pastoralist communities are subject to “strict rules of portability” encourages such communities to==

47. TPO 27 Predator-Prey Cycles (正确率 56.49%) 

    Predators are an essential factor in maintaining communities that are rich and diverse in species. <u>**Without** predators, the species that is the **best competitor** for food, shelter, nesting sites, and other environmental resources tends to dominate and exclude the species with which it competes.</u> **This** phenomenon is known as “==competitor exclusion==.” However, if the community contains a predator of the strongest competitor species, then the population of that competitor is controlled. Thus even the less competitive species are able to survive. For example, sea stars prey on a variety of bivalve mollusks and prevent these bivalves from monopolizing habitats on the sea floor. This opens up space for many other organisms. When sea stars are removed, species diversity falls sharply. Therefore, from the stand point of diversity, it is usually a mistake to eliminate a major predator from a community. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 7, which of the following is **true** of ==the phenomenon of competitor exclusion==? 

    A.It results in **more** diverse communities

48. TPO 9 Reflection in Teaching (正确率 55.93%) 

    The work of Wildman and Niles suggests the importance of recognizing some of the difficulties of instituting reflective practice. Others have noted this, making a similar point about the teaching profession's cultural inhibitions about reflective practice. Zeichner and Liston (1987) point out the inconsistency between the role of the teacher as a (reflective) professional decision maker and the more usual role of the teacher as a technician, putting into practice the ideas of others. <u>More basic than the cultural issues is the matter of **motivation**.</u> Becoming a reflective practitioner <u>requires extra work (Jaworski, 1993) and has only vaguely defined goals with, perhaps, **little initially perceivable reward** and the threat of vulnerability.</u> Few have directly questioned what might lead a teacher to want to become reflective. Apparently, the most obvious reason for teachers to work toward reflective practice is that teacher educators think it is a good thing. There appear to be many unexplored matters about the motivation to reflect-for example, the value of externally motivated reflection as opposed to that of teachers who might reflect by habit. 

    :grey_question: According to paragraph 6, ==teachers may be discouraged from reflecting== **because** 

    A.it is not generally supported by teacher educators

More than one-quarter of the world's oil and almost one-fifth of the world's natural gas come from offshore, even though offshore drilling is six to seven times more expensive than drilling on land. A significant part of this oil and gas comes from under the North Sea between Great Britain and Norway. Of course, there is far more oil underground than can be recovered. It may be in a pool too small or too far from a potential market to justify the expense of drilling. Some oil lies under regions where drilling is forbidden, such as national parks or other public lands. Even given the best extraction techniques, only about 30 to 40 percent of the oil in a given pool can be brought to the surface. The rest is far too difficult to extract and has to remain underground.

    These adaptations <u>allowed an increasing diversity of plant forms to exploit dry land</u>. Life on land, however, also required new methods of transporting sperm to eggs. Unlike aquatic and marine forms, land plants cannot always rely on water currents to carry their sex cells and disperse their fertilized eggs. So the most successful groups of land plants are those that evolved methods of fertilized sex cell dispersal that are independent of water and structures that protest developing embryos from drying out. Protected embryos and waterless dispersal of sex cells were achieved with the origin of seed plans and the key evolutionary innovations that they introduced: pollen, seeds, and later, flowers and fruits.

    Third, primary groups are fundamental because they serve as powerful instruments for social control. Their members command and dispense many of the rewards that are so vital to us and that make our lives seem worthwhile. Should the use of rewards fail, members can frequently win by rejecting or threatening to ostracize those who deviate from the primary group's norms. For instance, some social groups employ shunning (a person can remain in the community, but others are forbidden to interact with the person) as a device to bring into line individuals whose behavior goes beyond that allowed by the particular group. Even more important, primary groups define social reality for us by structuring our experiences. By providing us with definitions of situations, they elicit from us behavior that conforms to group- devised meanings. Primary groups, then, serve both as carriers of social norms and as enforcers of them.
