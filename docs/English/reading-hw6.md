1. TPO 20 Westward Migration (正确率 99.03%) 

    <u>Two other developments **presaged** the end of the era of turnpikes【A】</u> and stared a transportation revolution that <u>resulted in increased regional specialization【C】</u> and the growth of a national market economy First came the steamboat; <u>although flatboats and keelboats continued to be important until the 1850’s, steamboats eventually **superseded** all other craft in the carrying of passengers and freight. :star:Steamboats were not only **faster** but also transported upriver freight for about one tenth of what it had previously **cost** on hand-propelled keelboats.【B】</u> Next came the Erie Canal, an enormous project in its day, spanning about 350 miles. After the canal went into operation, the cost per mile of transporting a ton of freight from Buffalo to New York City declined from nearly 20 cents to less that 1 cent. Eventually, the western states diverted much of their produce from the rivers to the Erie Canal, a shorter route to eastern markets. 
    
    :grey_question: Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 5 about ==flatboats and keelboats==? 

    A.	They **ceased** to be used as soon as the first turnpikes were built. 

    B.	They were **slower** and **more expensive** to operate than steamboats. 

    C.	They were used for long distance but not for **regional** transportation.

    D.	They were used **primarily** on the Erie Canal.

2. TPO 14 Children and Advertising (正确率 97.08%) 

    Fantasy is one of the more common techniques in advertising that could possibly mislead a young audience. Child-oriented advertisements are more likely to include magic and fantasy than advertisements aimed at adults. In a content analysis of Canadian television, the author Stephen Kline observed that nearly all commercials for character toys featured fantasy play. Children have strong imaginations and the use of fantasy brings their ideas to life, but children may not be adept enough to realize that what they are viewing is unreal. Fantasy situations and settings are frequently used to attract children's attention, particularly in food advertising. Advertisements for breakfast cereals have, for many years, been found to be especially fond of fantasy techniques, with almost nine out of ten including such content. :star:<u>Generally, there is uncertainty as to whether very young children can **distinguish** between fantasy and reality in advertising.</u> Certainly, rational appeals in advertising aimed at children are limited, as most advertisements use emotional and indirect appeals to psychological states or associations. 

    :grey_question: Paragraph 3 indicates that there is **uncertainty** about which of the following issues involving ==children and fantasy in advertising==? 

    A.	Whether children can **tell** if what they are seeing in an advertisement is real or fantasy 
    
    B.	Whether children can **differentiate fantasy techniques** from other techniques used in advertising 
    
    C.	Whether children realize **how commonly** fantasy techniques are used in advertising aimed at them 
    
    D.	Whether children are attracted to advertisements that **lack** fantasy

3. TPO 21 The Origins of Agriculture (正确率96.1%) 

    <u>It would appear that the instability of the climatic conditions led populations that had originally been nomadic to settle down and develop a sedentary style of life【B】</u>, which led in turn to population growth and to the need to increase the amount of food available. Farming originated in these conditions. :star:<u>Later on, it became very difficult to change because of the significant expansion of these populations.</u> It could be argued, however, that these conditions are not sufficient to explain the origins of agriculture. Earth had experienced previous periods of climatic change, and yet agriculture had not been developed. 

    :grey_question: It can be inferred from paragraph 4 that ==it was difficult for people to change from farming back to hunting and gathering== **because** 

    A.	People had become more used to **different types** of food
    
    B.	**Climatic conditions** were no longer favorable for hunting and gathering
    
    C.	**Populations** had become too large to be supported by bunting and gathering

4. TPO 34 The Development of Steam Power (正确率 94.91%) 

    By the eighteenth century, Britain was experiencing a severe shortage of energy. :star:<u>Because of the growth of population, most of the great forests of medieval Britain had long ago been **replaced** by **fields of grain and hay**.【B / D】</u> Wood was in ever-shorter supply, yet it remained tremendously important. <u>It served as the primary source of heat for all homes【C】</u> and industries and as a basic raw material. Processed wood (charcoal) was the fuel that was mixed with iron ore in the blast furnace to produce pig iron (raw iron). The iron industry’s appetite for wood was enormous, and by 1740 the British iron industry was stagnating. <u>Vast forests enabled Russia to become the world’s leading producer of iron, much of which was **exported** to Britain【A】</u>. But Russia’s potential for growth was limited too, and in a few decades Russia would reach the barrier of inadequate energy that was already holding England back. 

    :grey_question: What can be inferred from paragraph 1 about ==Britain’s short supply of wood in the eighteenth century==? 

    A.	Wood from Britain’s great forests was being exported to other countries for profit.
    
    B.	A growing population had required cutting down forests to increase available land for **farming**.
    
    C.	Larger families required the construction of larger homes **made from wood**.

5. TPO 20 Early Settlements in the Southwest Asia (正确率 93.88%) 

    The flotation samples from the excavations allowed botanists to study shifts in plant-collection habits as if they were looking through a telescope at a changing landscape. Hundreds of tiny plant remains show how the inhabitants exploited nut harvests in nearby pistachio and oak forests. However, as the climate dried up, the forests retreated from the vicinity of the settlement. The inhabitants turned to wild cereal grasses instead, collecting them by the thousands, while the percentage of nuts in the diet fell. <u>By 8200 B.C., **drought conditions** were so severe that the people abandoned their long-established settlement, perhaps dispersing into smaller camps. </u>

    :grey_question: Paragraph 4 suggests that ==the people of Abu Hureyra abandoned their long-established settlement== **because** 

    A.	The inhabitants had cleared all the trees from the forests
    
    B.	Wild cereal grasses took over pistachio and oak forests

6. :exclamation:TPO 12 Which Hand Did They Use? (正确率 93.75%) 

    Fractures and other cut marks are another source of evidence. :star:<u>Right-handed soldiers tend to be wounded on the left.</u> The skeleton of a 40- or 50-year-old Nabatean warrior, buried 2,000 years ago in the Negev Desert, Israel, had multiple healed fractures to the skull, the left arm, and the ribs. 

    :grey_question: Which of the following statements about ==fractures and cut marks== can be inferred from paragraph 4? 

    A.	Fractures and cut marks caused by right-handed soldiers tend to occur on the right side of the injured party's body.
    
    B.	The right arm sustains more injuries because, as the dominant arm, it is used more actively.
    
    C.	In most people, the left side of the body is more vulnerable to injury since it is not defended effectively by the dominant arm. 
    
    D.	Fractures and cut marks on fossil humans probably occurred after death.

7. TPO 13 Types of Social Groups (正确率 93.48%) 
   
    Sociologists have built on the distinction between expressive and instrumental ties to distinguish between two types of groups: primary and secondary. A primary group involves two or more people who enjoy a direct, intimate, cohesive relationship with one another. Expressive ties predominate in primary groups; we view the people as ends in themselves and valuable in their own right. A secondary group entails two or more people who are involved in an impersonal relationship and have come together for a specific, practical purpose. 
    Instrumental ties predominate in secondary groups; we perceive people as means to ends rather than as ends in their own right. <u>Sometimes primary group relationships evolve out of secondary group relationships.</u> This happens in many work settings. People on the job often develop close relationships with coworkers as they come to share gripes, jokes, gossip, and satisfactions. 

    Which of the following can be inferred from the author's claim in paragraph 3 that ==primary group relationships sometimes evolve out of secondary group relationships==? 

    A.	Secondary group relationships **begin** by being primary group relationships.
    
    B.	A secondary group relationship that is **highly visible** quickly becomes a primary group relationship.
    
    C.	Sociologists believe that **only** primary group relationships are important to society.
    
    D.	Even in secondary groups, frequent communication serves to bring people into close relationships.

8. TPO 29 Characteristics of Roman Pottery (正确率 93.34%) 
    
    The pottery of ancient Romans is remarkable in several ways. <u>The high quality of Roman pottery is very easy to appreciate when handing actual pieces of tableware or indeed kitchenware and amphorae【A / D】</u> (the large jars used throughout the Mediterranean for the transport and storage of liquids, such as wine and oil). However, it is impossible to do justice to Roman wares on the page, even when words can be backed up by photographs and drawings. Most roman pottery is light and smooth to the touch and very tough, although, like all pottery, it shatters if dropped on a hard surface. <u>It is generally made with carefully selected and purified clay, worked to thin-walled and standardized shapes on a fast wheel and fired in a kiln (pottery oven) capable of ensuring a consistent finish.【C】</u> With handmade pottery, inevitably there are slight differences between individual vessels of the same design and occasional minor blemishes (flaws). But what strikes the eye and the touch most immediately and most powerfully with Roman pottery is its consistent high quality. 

    :grey_question: Paragraph 1 indicates which of the following about ==Roman pottery==? 

    A.	Roman **amphorae** were of much higher quality overall than other Roman pottery.
    
    B.	Romany pottery can best be appreciated when actual pieces are handled.
    
    C.	Roman pottery **declined** slightly in quality when the use of fast wheels and kilns was introduced.
    
    D.	Roman practical tableware **spread more rapidly** across the Mediterranean than amphorae did.

9. TPO 11 Orientation and Navigation (正确率 92.1%) 

    To South Americans, robins are birds that fly north every spring. To North Americans, the robins simply vacation in the south each winter. <u>Furthermore, they fly to very **specific** places in South America and will often come back to the **same** trees in North American yards the following spring.【C / D】</u> The question is not why they would leave the cold of winter so much as how they find their way around. The question perplexed people for years, until, in the 1950s, a German scientist named Gustave Kramer provided some answers and. in the process, raised new questions. 

    :grey_question: Which of the following can be inferred about ==bird migration== from paragraph 1? 

    A.	Birds will take **the most direct** migratory route to their new habitat.
    
    B.	The **purpose** of migration is to join with larger groups of birds.
    
    C.	Bird migration generally involves moving back and forth between north and south.

10. TPO 8 The Rise of Teotihuacán (正确率 91.76%) 
    
    How did this tremendous development take place, and why did it happen in the Teotihuacán Valley? Among the main factors are Teotihuacán’s geographic location on a natural trade route to the south and east of the Valley of Mexico, the obsidian resources in the Teotihuacán Valley itself, and <u>the valley’s potential for extensive irrigation【D】</u>. The exact role of other factors is much more difficult to pinpoint―for instance, Teotihuacán’s religious significance as a shrine, the historical situation in and around the Valley of Mexico toward the end of the first millennium B.C., the ingenuity and foresightedness of Teotihuacán’s elite, and, finally, the impact of natural disasters, such as the volcanic eruptions of the late first millennium B.C. This last factor is at least circumstantially implicated in Teotihuacán’s rise. Prior to 200 B.C., a number of relatively small centers coexisted in and near the Valley of Mexico.<u> Around this time, the largest of these centers, Cuicuilco, was seriously affected by a volcanic eruption</u>, with much of its agricultural land covered by lava. With Cuicuilco eliminated as a potential rival, any one of a number of relatively modest towns might have emerged as a leading economic and political power in Central Mexico. The archaeological evidence clearly indicates, though, that <u>Teotiluacan was the center that did arise as the predominant force in the area by the first century A.D. </u>

    :grey_question: Which of the following can be inferred from paragraphs 2 and 3 about ==the Volcanic eruptions of the late first millennium B.C.==? 

    A.	They were more frequent than historians once thought.
    
    B.	They may have done more damage to Teotihuacán than to neighboring centers.
    
    C.	They may have played a major role in the rise of Teotihuacán.
    
    D.	They increased the need for extensive irrigation in the Teotihuacán Valley

11. :exclamation:TPO 31 Speciation in Geographically Isolated Populations (正确率 50.7%) 
    
    In the 1980s, John Graves studied two populations of closely related fishes, one population from the Atlantic side of isthmus, the other from the Pacific side. He compared four enzymes found in the muscles of each population. <u>Graves found that all four Pacific enzymes function **better** at lower temperatures than the four Atlantic versions of the same enzymes. This is significant because Pacific seawater if typically 2 to 3 degrees **cooler** than seawater on the Atlantic side of isthmus.【A】</u> Analysis by gel electrophoresis revealed slight differences in amino acid sequence of the enzymes of two of the four pairs. This is significant because the amino acid sequence of an enzyme is determined by genes. 

    Graves drew two conclusions from these observations. <u>First, at least some of the observed differences between the enzymes of the Atlantic and Pacific fish populations were not random but were the result of evolutionary adaptation. Second, it appears that closely related populations of fishes on both sides of the isthmus are starting to genetically **diverge from** each other【B】.</u> Because Graves’ study of geographically isolated populations of isthmus fishes offers a glimpse of the beginning of a process of gradual accumulation of mutations that are neutral or adaptive, divergences here might be evidence of allopatric speciation in process. 

    :grey_question: It can be inferred from paragraph 5 and 6 that the reason Graved concluded that ==some of the differences between the Pacific and Atlantic enzymes were not random== was that 

    A.	Each of the Pacific enzymes works better in cooler waters

    B.	The enzymes of the Atlantic fish populations had **not changed** since the formation of the Isthmus of Panama

    C.	Gel electrophoresis showed that the changes benefited **both** the Atlantic and the Pacific fish populations

    D.	The differences between the enzymes **disappeared** when the two fish populations were experimentally switched to other side of the isthmus

    <u>**While** many programs designed for preschoolers focus primarily on social and emotional factors【D】</u>, some are geared mainly toward promoting cognitive gains and preparing preschoolers for the formal instruction they will experience <u>when they start kindergarten【B】.</u> <u>In the United States, the best-known program designed to promote future academic success is Head Start. :star:Established in the 1960s when the United States declared **the War on Poverty**【A】, the program has served over 13 million children and their families.</u> The program, which stresses parental involvement, was designed to serve the “whole child”, including children’s physical health, self- confidence, social responsibility, and social and emotional development. 

    :grey_question: It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that ==the Head Start program was designed to serve children== who 

    A.	Come from families that do not have a lot of money

13. :exclamation:TPO 19 Discovering the Ice Ages (正确率 48.84%) 
    
    Isotopic analysis of shells allowed geologists to measure another glacial effect. They could trace the growth and shrinkage of continental glaciers, <u>even in parts of the ocean where there may have been no great change in temperature【C】— around the equator, for example.</u> The oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice. During glaciations, the lighter oxygen-16 has a greater tendency to evaporate from the ocean surface than the heavier oxygen-18 does. Thus, more of the heavy isotope is left behind in the ocean and absorbed by marine organisms. From this analysis of marine sediments, geologists have learned that there were many shorter, more regular cycles of glaciation and deglaciation than geologists had recognized from the glacial drift of the continents alone. 

    It can be inferred from paragraph 5 that ==foraminifera fossil shells containing calcite with high percentages of oxygen-16 were deposited at times== **when** 

    A.	polar ice extended as far as equatorial regions of land and sea 

    B.	extensive glaciation was not occurring

14. :exclamation:TPO 18 Lightning (正确率 47.06%) 

    The formation of the channel is initiated when electrons surge from the cloud base toward the ground. <u>When a stream of these negatively charged electrons comes within 100 meters of the ground【B】</u> it is met by a stream of positively charged particles that comes up from the ground. When the negatively and positively charged streams meet, a complete channel connecting the cloud and the ground is formed. <u>The channel is **only** a few centimeters in diameter【A】, but that is wide enough for electrons to follow the channel to the ground in the visible form of a flash of lightning.【D】</u> <u>The stream of positive particles</u> that meets the surge of electrons from the cloud <u>often arises from a tall pointed structure such as a metal flagpole or a tower.【C】</u> That is why the subsequent lightning that follows the completed channel often strikes a tall structure. 

    Which of the following claims about ==lightning strikes== can be inferred from paragraph 5? 

    A.	During a lightning strike the diameter of the channel the electrons follow is considerably enlarged **beyond** a few centimeters 

    B.	A building is unlikely to be hit by lightning **unless** it is at least 100 meters tail 

    C.	A building is hit by a lightning strike because the building itself has **first determined** the path the lightning then takes to it 

    D.	The light of a lightning strike first appears at the point where the streams of negative and positive particles meet

15. :exclamation:TPO 11 Begging by Nestlings (正确率 46.84%) 

    Further evidence for the costs of begging comes from a study of differences in the begging calls of warbler species that nest on the ground versus those that nest in the relative safety of trees. <u>The young of ground-nesting warblers produce begging cheeps of **higher frequencies** than do their tree-nesting relatives.【D】 These higher-frequency sounds do **not travel as far**【B】, and so may **better conceal** the individuals producing them【C】, who are especially vulnerable to predators in their ground nests.</u> David Haskell created artificial nests with clay eggs and placed them on the ground beside a tape recorder that played the begging calls of either tree-nesting or of ground-nesting warblers. The eggs “advertised” by the tree-nesters' begging calls were found bitten significantly more often than the eggs associated with the ground-nesters’ calls. 

    :grey_question: Paragraph 2 indicates that ==the begging calls of tree nesting warblers== 

    A.	put them at **more risk** than ground-nesting warblers experience 

    B.	can be heard from a **greater distance** than those of ground-nesting warblers

16. :exclamation:TPO 3 The Long-Term Stability of Ecosystems (正确率 44.63%) 
    
    Even the kind of stability defined as simple lack of change is not always associated with maximum diversity. <u>At least in temperate zones【C】</u>, <u>maximum diversity is often found in mid- successional stages【D】</u>, not in the climax community. :star:<u>Once a redwood forest matures, for example, the kinds of species and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are **reduced**.【B】</u> In general, diversity, by itself, does not ensure stability. Mathematical models of ecosystems likewise suggest that diversity does not guarantee ecosystem stability—just the opposite, in fact. A more complicated system is, in general, more likely than a simple system to break down. (A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child’s tricycle.)

    :grey_question: Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 5 about ==redwood forests==? 

    A.	They become **less stable** as they mature.

17. :exclamation:TPO 7 The Geologic History of the Mediterranean (正确率 41.67%) 
    
    With question such as these clearly before them, the scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger processed to the Mediterranean to search for the answers. On August 23, 1970, they recovered a sample. The sample consisted of pebbles of gypsum and fragments of volcanic rock. Not a single pebble was found that might have indicated that the pebbles came from the nearby continent. In the days following, samples of solid gypsum were repeatedly brought on deck as drilling operations penetrated the seafloor. Furthermore, the gypsum was found to possess peculiarities of composition and structure that suggested <u>it had formed on desert flats【D】</u>. <u>Sediment above and below the gypsum layer contained tiny marine fossils【A】, indicating open- ocean conditions【B】.</u> <u>As they drilled into the central and deepest part of the Mediterranean basin, the scientists took solid, shiny, crystalline salt from the core barrel【C】</u>. Interbedded with the salt were thin layers of what appeared to be windblown silt. 

    Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 3 about ==the solid gypsum layer==? 

    A.	It did not contain any marine fossil. 
    
    B.	It had formed in open-ocean conditions.

18. :exclamation:TPO 27 Predator-Prey Cycles (正确率32.49%) 
    
    When experimental populations are set up under simple laboratory conditions, the predator often exterminates its prey and then becomes extinct itself, having nothing left to eat. However, if safe areas like those prey animals have in the wild are provided, the prey population drops to low levels but not to extinction. Low prey population levels then provide inadequate food for the predators, causing the predator population to decrease. When this occurs, the prey population can rebound. <u>In this situation the predator and prey populations may continue in this cyclical pattern for some time. 【B】</u>
    
    <u>Population cycles are **characteristic** of small mammals, and they sometimes appear to be brought about by predators. </u> Ecologists studying hare populations have found that <u>the North American snow shoe hare follows a roughly ten-year cycle【C】</u>. Its numbers fall tenfold to thirty in a typical cycle, and a hundredfold change can occur. Two factors appear to be generating the cycle: food plants and predators.

    :grey_question: Which of the following can be inferred from paragraphs 2 and 3 about ==the small mammals that experience population cycles==? 

    A.	Their population cycles are **not** affected by predators 
    
    B.	Their predators’ populations **periodically** disappear

19. :exclamation:TPO 17 Symbiotic Relationships (正确率 32.38%) 
    
    At times, it is actually possible to watch the effects of natural selection in host-parasite relationships. For example, Australia during the 1940 s was overrun by hundreds of millions of European rabbits. The rabbits destroyed huge expanses of Australia and threatened the sheep and cattle industries. In 1950, myxoma virus, a parasite that affects rabbits, was deliberately introduced into Australia to control the rabbit population. Spread rapidly by mosquitoes, the virus devastated the rabbit population. The virus was less deadly to the offspring of surviving rabbits, however, and it caused less and less harm over the years. Apparently, genotypes (the genetic make-up of an organism) in the rabbit population were selected that were better able to resist the parasite. <u>Meanwhile, the deadliest strains of the virus perished with their hosts as natural selection favored strains that could infect hosts but not kill them.【D】</u> Thus, natural selection stabilized this host-parasite relationship. 
    
    :grey_question: Which of the following can be concluded from the discussion in paragraph 3 about ==the Australian rabbit population==? 
    
    A.	Human intervention may alter the host, the parasite and the relationship between them.
    
    B.	The risks of introducing outside organisms into a biological community are not worth the benefits.
    
    C.	Humans should not interfere in host-parasite relationships.
    
    D.	Organisms that survive a parasitic attack do so in spite of the natural selection process.

20. TPO 6 Infantile Amnesia (正确率27.5%) 
    
    Three other explanations seem more promising. One involves physiological changes relevant to memory. Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain continues throughout early childhood, and this part of the brain may be critical for remembering particular episodes in ways that can be retrieved later. <u>Demonstrations of infants’ and toddlers’ long-term memory have involved their repeating motor activities that they had seen or done earlier【B】</u>, such as reaching in the dark for objects, putting a bottle in a doll’s mouth, or pulling apart two pieces of a toy. <u>The brain’s level of physiological maturation may support these types of memories, but not ones requiring explicit verbal descriptions.【D】</u>
    
    :grey_question: What does paragraph 3 suggest about ==long-term memory in children==? 
    
    A.	Maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain is important for the long-term memory of motor activities but **not** verbal descriptions.
    
    B.	Young children may form long-term memories of actions they see earlier than of things they hear or are told. 
    
    C.	Young children have better long-term recall of **short** verbal exchanges than of long ones.
