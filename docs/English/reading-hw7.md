1. TPO 24 Lake Water (正确率 97.56%) 

    <u>Residence times vary **enormously**.:star: They **range from** a few days for small lakes up **to** several hundred years for large ones</u>; Lake Tahoe, in California, has a residence time of 700 years. The residence times for ==the Great Lakes== of North America, namely, Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, are, respectively, 190,100,22,2.5, and 6 years. Lake Erie’s is the lowest: although its area is larger than Lake Ontario’ s, its volume is less than one-third as great because it is so shallow-less than 20 meters on average. 

    :grey_question: Why does the author discuss ==the Great Lakes== in paragraph 5? 

    A. To demonstrate the extent to which residence times **vary from** lake to lake 

    B. To illustrate **how** residence times are calculated for specific lakes 

    C. To argue that the residence time of a lake **increases with area** 

    D. To emphasize that Lake Tahoe’s residence time is **unusually long**

2. TPO 34 The Development of Steam Power (正确率 97.09%) 

    :star:<u>The economic consequence of these technical innovations in steam power was a great **boom** in the British iron industry.</u> In 1740 annual British iron production was only 17,000 tons, but by 1844, with the spread of coke smelting and the impact of Cort’s inventions, it had increased to 3,000,000 tons. This was a truly amazing expansion. Once scarce and expensive, iron became cheap, basic, and indispensable to the economy. 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 6, why does the author compare ==British iron production in 1740 with that of 1844==? 

    A. To contrast the amounts of iron **needed** in Britain in two different centuries 

    B. To illustrate **how easy** it was to make money using Cort’s invention 

    C. To demonstrate **the tremendous growth** of the iron industry in Britain

3. TPO 29 Competition (正确率 96.89%) 

    When several individuals of the same species or of several different species depend on the same limited resource, a situation may arise that is referred to as competition. The existence of competition has been long known to naturalists; its effects were described by Darwin in considerable detail. Competition among individuals of the same species (intraspecies competition), one of the major mechanisms of natural selection, is the concern of evolutionary biology. Competition among the individuals of different species (interspecies competition) is a major concern of ecology. :star:<u>It is one of the factors controlling the size of competing populations, and extreme cases it may lead to the **extinction** of one of the competing species.【B】</u> This was described by Darwin for ==indigenous New Zealand species of animals and plants==, which dies out when **competing** species from Europe were introduced. 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 1, why does the author mention ==what happened in New Zealand==? 

    A. To indicate that Darwin understood the importance of competition 

    B. To illustrate that competition can lead to the extinction of species 

    C. To identify where the idea of competition among species **first** arose 

    D. To argue against the idea that the process of selection is a natural occurrence

4. TPO 25 The Surface of Mars (正确率 96.70%) 

    The great height of Martian volcanoes is a direct consequence of the planet’s low surface gravity. As lava flows and spreads to form a shield volcano, the volcano’s eventual height depends on the new mountain’s ability to support its own weight. :star:<u>The lower the gravity, the lesser the weight and the greater the height of the mountain</u>. It is no accident that ==Maxwell Mons on Venus and the Hawaiian shield volcanoes on Earth== rise to about the same height (about 10 kilometers) above their respective bases-<u>Earth and Venus have similar surface gravity.</u> Mars’s surface gravity is only 40 percent that of Earth, so volcanoes rise roughly 2.5 times as high. Are the Martian shield volcanoes still active? Scientists have no direct evidence for recent or ongoing eruptions, but if these volcanoes were active as recently as 100 million years ago (an estimate of the time of last eruption based on the extent of impact catering on their slopes), some of them may still be at least intermittently active. Millions of years, though, may pass between eruptions. 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 3, why does the author compare ==Maxwell Mons on Venus to the Hawaiian shield volcanoes on Earth==? 

    A. To help explain the relationship between surface gravity and volcano height 

    B. To explain why **Mars’s** surface gravity is only 40 percent of Earth’s 

    C. To point out **differences** between the surface gravity of Earth and the surface gravity of Venus 

    D. To argue that there are more similarities than differences between volcanoes on different planets

5. TPO 29 Competition (正确率 96.11%) 

    No serious competition exists when the major needed resources is in superabundant supply, as in most cases of the coexistence of herbivores (plant eaters). Furthermore, most species do not depend entirely on a single resource, if the major resource for a species becomes scarce, the species can usually shift to alternative resources. If more than one species is competing for a scarce resource, the competing species usually switch to different alternative resources. Competition is usually most severe among close relatives with similar demands on the environment. But it may also occur among totally unrelated forms that compete for the same resource, such as seed-eating rodents and ants. The effects of such competition are graphically demonstrated when all the animals or all the plants in an ecosystem come into competition, as happened 2 million years ago at the end of the Pliocene, when ==North South America became joined by the Isthmus of Panama==. ==North and South American== species migrating across the Isthmus now came into competition with each other. :star:<u>The result was the **extermination** of a large fraction of the South American mammals, which were apparently **unable** to withstand the competition from invading North American species--although added predation was **also** an important factor.</u> 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 2, why does the author talk about what happened as a result of ==North and South America becoming joined at the Isthmus of Panama==? 

    A. To make the point that predation can have **as** much effect on species survival **as** competition does 

    B. To show how the ability to switch to an alternative resource can give a species a competitive advantage 

    C. To account for the **current** species composition of North and south America 

    D. To provide an example of the serious effects of competition between unrelated species

6.  TPO 13 Biological Clocks (正确率 95.73%) 

    Survival and successful reproduction usually require the activities of animals to be coordinated with predictable events around them. Consequently, the timing and rhythms of biological functions must closely match periodic events like the solar day, the tides, the lunar cycle, and the seasons. The relations between animal activity and these periods, particularly for the daily rhythms, have been of such interest and importance that a huge amount of work has been done on them and the special research field of chronobiology has emerged. Normally, the constantly changing levels of an animal's activity—sleeping, feeding, moving, reproducing, metabolizing, and producing enzymes and hormones, for example—are well coordinated with environmental rhythms, but the key question is whether the animal's schedule is driven by external cues, such as sunrise or sunset, or is instead dependent somehow on internal timers that themselves generate the observed biological rhythms. Almost universally, biologists accept the idea that all eukaryotes (a category that includes most organisms except bacteria and certain algae) have internal clocks. :star:<u>By isolating organisms completely from external periodic cues, biologists learned that organisms have internal clocks【B】</u>. **For instance**, apparently normal daily periods of biological activity were maintained for about a week by ==the fungus Neurospora== when it was intentionally isolated from all geophysical timing cues while orbiting in a space shuttle. The continuation of biological rhythms in an organism without external cues attests to its having an internal clock. 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 1, ==the experiment on the fungus Neurospora== is mentioned to illustrate 

    A. the existence of **weekly** periods of activity as well as **daily** ones 

    B. the finding of evidence that organisms have internal clocks 

    C. the **effect** of space on the internal clocks of organisms 

    D. the isolation of **one** part of an organism's cycle for study

7. TPO 8 The Rise of Teotihuacán (正确率 95.51%) 

    :star:<u>The picture of Teotihuacán that emerges is a classic picture of **positive feedback** among obsidian mining and working, trade, population growth, irrigation, and religious tourism.</u> ==The thriving obsidian operation==, **for example**, <u>would necessitate more miners, additional manufacturers of obsidian tools, and additional traders to carry the goods to new markets.</u> All this led to increased wealth, which in turn would attract more immigrants to Teotihuacán. The growing power of the elite, who controlled the economy, would give them the means to physically coerce people to move to Teotihuacán and serve as additions to the labor force. More irrigation works would have to be built to feed the growing population, and this resulted in more power and wealth for the elite. 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 6, the author discusses the ==“The thriving obsidian operation”== in order to 

    A. explain why manufacturing was the **main** industry of Teotihuacán 

    B. give an example of an industry that took very **little time** to develop in Teotihuacán 

    C. illustrate **how several factors influenced each other** to make Teotihuacán a powerful and wealthy city

8. :question:TPO 5 Minerals and Plants (正确率 95.24%) 

    Scientists have known for some time that <u>certain plants, called hyper accumulators, can **concentrate** minerals at levels a hundredfold or greater than normal.【A】</u> A survey of known hyper accumulators identified that 75 percent of them amassed nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, manganese, lead, and cadmium are other minerals of choice. :star:<u>Hyper accumulators run the **entire** range of the plant world.</u> **They** may be ==herbs, shrubs, or trees==. Many members of the mustard family, spurge family, legume family, and grass family are top hyper accumulators. Many are found in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, where accumulation of high concentrations of metals may afford some protection against plant-eating insects and microbial pathogens. 

    :grey_question: Why does the author mention ==herbs, shrubs, and trees==? 

    A. To provide examples of plant types that **cannot tolerate** high levels of harmful minerals. 

    B. To show why so many plants are hyper accumulators. 

    C. To help explain why hyper accumulators **can be found** in so many different **places**. 

    D. To emphasize that hyper accumulators occur in a wide range of **plant types**.

9. TPO 3 Depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer (正确率 94.74%) 

    The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the drought years of the early 1930’s. The ensuing rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture, especially from the 1950’s onward, :star:<u>transformed the economy of the region</u>. More than 100,000 wells now tap the Ogallala. Modern irrigation devices, each capable of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a landscape dominated by geometric patterns of circular green islands of crops. :star:<u>Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains region to supply significant amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States</u>. **In addition**, ==40 percent of American grain-fed beef cattle are fattened here==. 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 3, why does the author provide the information that ==40 percent of American cattle are fattened in the High Plains==? 

    A. To suggest that crop cultivation is not the **most** important part of the economy of the High Plains 

    B. To indicate that **not all** economic activity in the High Plains is dependent on irrigation 

    C. To provide another example of how water from the Ogallala has **transformed** the economy of the High Plains

10. TPO 15 A Warm-Blooded Turtle (正确率 94.20%) 

    In a countercurrent exchange system , the blood vessels carrying cooled blood from the flippers run close enough to the blood vessels carrying warm blood from the body to pick up some heat from the warmer blood vessels; **thus**, :star:<u>the heat is transferred from the outgoing to the ingoing vessels before it reaches the flipper itself.</u> **This is the same arrangement** found in an ==old-fashioned steam radiator==, in which the coiled pipes pass heat back and forth as water courses through them. The leatherback is certainly not the only animal with such an arrangement; gulls have a countercurrent exchange in their legs. That is why a gull can stand on an ice floe without freezing. 

    :grey_question: Why does the author mention ==old-fashioned steam radiator== in the discussion of countercurrent exchange systems? 

    A. To argue that a turtle’s central heating system is **not as highly evolved as** that of other warmblooded animals 

    B. To provide a useful comparison with which to illustrate how a countercurrent exchange system works 

    C. To suggest that steam radiators were **modeled after** the sophisticated heating system of turtles

11. :exclamation:TPO 17 Europe's Early Sea Trade with Asia (正确率 59.93%) 

    :star:<u>The astrolabe had long been the primary instrument for navigation, having been introduced in the eleventh century.</u> It operated by measuring the height of the Sun and the fixed stars: by calculating the angles created by these points, it determined the degree of latitude at which one stood (The problem of determining longitude, though, was not solved until the eighteenth century.) By the early thirteenth century. ==Western Europeans had also developed and put into use the magnetic compass==, <u>which helped when clouds obliterated both the Sun and the stars</u>. Also beginning in the thirteenth century, there were new maps refined by precise calculations and the reports of sailors that made it possible to trace one's path with reasonable accuracy. Certain institutional and practical norms had become established as well. A maritime code known as the Consulate of the Sea which originated in the western Mediterranean region in the fourteenth century, won acceptance by a majority of sea goers as the normative code for maritime conduct; it defined such matters as the authority of a ship's officers, protocols of command, pay structures, the rights of sailors, and the rules of engagement when ships met one another on the sea-lanes. Thus by about 1400 the key elements were in place to enable Europe to begin its seaward adventure. 

    :grey_question: Why does the author include the information that ==Western Europeans had developed and put into use the magnetic compass==? 

    A. To provide an example of an instrument that was developed **after** caravels had begun traveling across oceans 

    B. To provide an example of an improvement that **resulted directly** from the invention of the astrolabe

12. :question: TPO 24 Moving into Pueblos (正确率 57.74%)

    Another important push was the onset of the Little Ice Age, a climatic phenomenon that led to cooler temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. Although the height of the Little Ice Age was still around the corner, some evidence suggests that temperatures were falling during the thirteenth century. <u>The environmental changes associated with this transition are not fully understood, but people living closest to the San Juan Mountains, to the northeast of Mesa Verde, were affected first.</u> ==Growing food at these elevations is always difficult because of the short growing season==. As the Little Ice Age progressed, farmers probably moved their fields to lower elevations, infringing on the lands of other farmers and pushing people together, thus contributing to the aggregations. Archaeologists identify a corresponding shift in populations toward the south and west toward Mesa Verde and away from higher elevations. 

    :grey_question: Why does the author state that ==“Growing food at these elevations is always difficult because of the short growing season”==? 

    A. To explain why the higher elevations were always relatively **sparsely populated** 

    B. To suggest that **any** worsening of conditions would have significant consequences 

    C. To emphasize **how resourceful** the people growing food at these elevations were

13. TPO 11 Begging by Nestlings (正确率55.58%) 

    As these experiments show, begging apparently provides a signal of need that parents use to make judgments about which offspring can benefit most from a feeding. But the question arises, why don't nestlings beg loudly when they aren't all that hungry? By doing so, they could possibly secure more food, which should result in more rapid growth or larger size, either of which is advantageous. :star:<u>The answer lies **apparently not** in the increased energy costs of exaggerated begging—==such energy costs are small relative to the potential gain in calories==— but rather in the **damage** that any successful cheater would do to its siblings, which share genes with one another.</u> An individual's success in propagating his or her genes can be affected by more than just his or her own personal reproductive success. Because close relatives have many of the same genes, animals that harm their close relatives may in effect be destroying some of their own genes. Therefore, a begging nestling that secures food at the expense of its siblings might actually leave behind fewer copies of its genes overall than it might otherwise. 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 6, the author compares ==the energy costs of vigorous begging with the potential gain in calories from such begging== in order to 

    A. explain why begging for food vigorously can lead to faster growth and increased size. 

    B. explain how begging vigorously can increase an individual’s chance of propagating its own genes 

    C. point out a **weakness** in a possible explanation for why nestlings do not always beg vigorously 

    D. argue that the benefits of vigorous begging **outweigh** any possible disadvantages

14. :question:TPO 13 Biological Clocks (正确率 53.99%) 

    When crayfish are kept continuously in the dark, even for four to five months, their compound eyes continue to adjust on a daily schedule for daytime and nighttime vision. Horseshoe crabs kept in the dark continuously for a year were found to maintain a persistent rhythm of brain activity that similarly adapts their eyes on a daily schedule for bright or for weak light. <u>Like **almost** all daily cycles of animals **deprived of** environmental cues, those measured for the horseshoe crabs in these conditions were **not exactly** 24 hours. Such a rhythm whose period is **approximately**—but not exactly—a day is called circadian</u>. ==For different individual horseshoe crabs, the circadian period ranged from 22.2 to 25.5 hours==. A particular animal typically maintains its own characteristic cycle duration with great precision for many days. Indeed, stability of the biological clock's period is one of its major features, even when the organism's environment is subjected to considerable changes in factors, such as temperature, that would be expected to affect biological activity strongly. Further evidence for persistent internal rhythms appears when the usual external cycles are shifted—either experimentally or by rapid eastwest travel over great distances. Typically, the animal's daily internally generated cycle of activity continues without change. As a result, its activities are shifted relative to the external cycle of the new environment. The disorienting effects of this mismatch between external time cues and internal schedules may persist, like our jet lag, for several days or weeks until certain cues such as the daylight/darkness cycle reset the organism's clock to synchronize with the daily rhythm of the new environment. 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 2, why does the author mention that ==the period for different horseshoe crabs ranges from 22.2 to 25.5 hours==? 

    A. To illustrate that an animal's internal clock **seldom** has a 24-hour cycle 

    B. To argue that different horseshoe crabs will shift from daytime to nighttime vision at different times 

    C. To illustrate the approximate range of the circadian rhythm of **all animals** 

    D. To support the idea that external cues are the **only** factors affecting an animal's periodic behavior

15. :question:TPO 19 Discovering the Ice Ages (正确率 53.27%) 

    <u>Isotopic analysis of shells allowed geologists to measure another glacial effect. They could trace the growth and shrinkage of continental glaciers, **even** in parts of the ocean where there may have been no great change in temperature— around the equator, for example.</u> ==The oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice.== During glaciations, the lighter oxygen-16 has a greater tendency to evaporate from the ocean surface than the heavier oxygen-18 does. Thus, more of the heavy isotope is left behind in the ocean and absorbed by marine organisms. From this analysis of marine sediments, geologists have learned that there were many shorter, more regular cycles of glaciation and deglaciation than geologists had oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by the evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice recognized from the glacial drift of the continents alone. 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 5, why does the author include the information that the ==“oxygen isotope ratio of the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is precipitated as snow to form glacial ice”==? 

    A. To explain how scientists were able to calculate **how frequently** the continental ice sheets expanded and contracted 

    B. To explain how scientists have determined that there was **no great change** in ocean temperatures at the equator during past glaciations 

    C. To provide evidence that oxygen-16 has a greater tendency to evaporate than does oxygen-18

16. :question:TPO 20 Fossil Preservation (正确率 52.13%) 

    When one considers the many ways by which organisms are completely destroyed after death, it is remarkable that fossils are as common as they are. Attack by scavengers and bacteria, chemical decay, and destruction by erosion and other geologic agencies make the odds against preservation very high. However, the chances of escaping complete destruction are vastly improved if the organism happens to have a mineralized skeleton and dies in a place where it can be quickly buried by sediment. <u>**Both** of these conditions are often found on the **ocean floors**</u>, where shelled invertebrates (organisms without spines) flourish and are covered by the continuous rain of sedimentary particles. Although most fossils are found in marine sedimentary rocks, they also are found in terrestrial deposits left by streams and lakes. <u>On occasion, animals and plants have been preserved after becoming immersed in tar or quicksand, trapped in ice or lave flows, or engulfed by rapid falls of volcanic ash.</u> 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 1, what is the author’s purpose in providing examples of ==how organisms are destroyed==? 

    A. To emphasize how surprising it is that **so many fossils exist** 

    B. To introduce **a new geologic theory** of fossil preservation 

    C. To explain why the fossil record until now has **remained incomplete** 

    D. To **compare** how fossils form on land and in water

17. :question:TPO 20 Fossil Preservation (正确率 50.26%) 

    The term “fossil” often implies petrifaction, literally a transformation into stone. After the death of an organism, the soft tissue is ordinarily consumed by scavengers and bacteria. They empty shell of a snail or clam may be left behind, and if it is sufficiently durable and resistant to dissolution, it may remain basically unchanged for a long period of time. Indeed, unaltered the ocean changes as a great deal of water is withdrawn from it by evaporation and is oxygen isotope ratio of precipitated as snow to form glacial ice shells of marine invertebrates are known from deposits over 100 million years old. In many marine creatures, **however**, the skeleton is composed of mineral variety of calcium carbonate called ==aragonite==. <u>Although aragonite has the same composition as the more familiar mineral known as calcite, it has a different crystal form, is relatively unstable, and in time **changes** to the more stable calcite.</u> 

    :grey_question: Why does the author mention ==“aragonite”== in the passage? 

    A. To emphasize that some fossils remain **unaltered** for millions of years. 

    B. To contrast fossil formation in organisms with **soft tissue** and in organisms with **hard shells** 

    C. To explain that some marine organisms must undergo chemical changes in order to fossilize 

    D. To explain why fossil shells are more likely to survive than are fossil skeletons

18. :exclamation:TPO 18 Lightning (正确率 44.12%) 

    Most lightning takes place within a cloud when the charge separation within the cloud collapses. However, as the storm cloud develops, the ground beneath the cloud becomes positively charged and lightning can take place in the form of an electrical discharge between the negative charge of the cloud and the positively charged ground. ==Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive==, <u>**so** even though it represents only 20 percent of all lightning, it has received a lot of **scientific attention**.</u> 

    :grey_question: The author remarks that ==“Lightning that strikes the ground is the most likely to be destructive”== in order to explain why 

    A. this form of lightning has been investigated so much 

    B. this form of lightning is not as common as lightning within a cloud 

    C. scientific understanding of this form of lightning is important 

    D. the buildup of positive charge on the ground beneath a storm cloud can have serious consequences

19. TPO 23 Rock Art of the Australia Aborigines (正确率 40.43%) 

    In the 1970s when the study of Australian archaeology was in an exciting phase of development, with the great antiquity of rock art becoming clear. Lesley Maynard, the archaeologist who coined the phrase “Panaramitee style,” suggested that a sequence could be determined for Australian rock art, in which a geometric style gave way to a simple figurative style (outlines of figures and animals), followed by a range of complex figurative styles that, unlike the pan-Australian geometric tradition tended to much greater regional diversity. While accepting that this sequence fits the archaeological profile of those sites, which were occupied continuously over many thousands of years a number of writers have warned that the underlying assumption of such a sequence—a development from the simple and the geometric to the complex and naturalistic—obscures the cultural continuities in Aboriginal Australia, in which geometric symbolism remains fundamentally important. <u>In this context the simplicity of a geometric motif may be more apparent than real. Motifs of seeming simplicity can encode complex meanings in Aboriginal Australia</u>. And ==has not twentieth-century art shown that naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction in some kind of predetermine sequence==? 

    :grey_question: In paragraph 5, the author indicates that ==twentieth century art has shown that naturalism does not necessarily follow abstraction in some kind of predetermined sequence== in order to 

    A. emphasize that it may **not be possible** to determine what the figures in ancient rock art represent 

    B. suggest a reply to those who have **questioned** Maynard’s interpretation of the sequence of Australian rock art 

    C. provide a **counterexample** to Maynard’s interpretation of the sequence of Australian rock art

    D. indicate that twentieth century art is **more advanced** than ancient rock art

20. TPO 33 Railroads and Commercial Agriculture in Nineteenth-Century United States (正确率 37.49%) 

    As railroad lines fanned out from Chicago, farmers began to acquire open prairie land in Illinois and then lowa, putting the fertile, deep black soil into production. <u>Commercial agriculture transformed this remarkable treeless environment. To settlers accustomed to eastern woodlands, the thousands of square miles of tall grass were an awesome sight.</u> ==Indian grass, Canada wild rye, and native big bluestem all grew higher than a person==. Because eastern plows could not penetrate the densely tangled roots of prairie grass, the earliest settlers erected farms along the boundary separating the forest from the prairie. In 1837, however, John Deere patented a sharp-cutting steel plow that sliced through the sod without soil sticking to the blade. Cyrus McCormic refined a mechanical reaper that harvested fourteen times more wheat with the same amount of labor. By the 1850s McCormick was selling 1,000 reapers a year and could not keep up with demand, while Deere turned out 10,000 plows annually. 

    :grey_question: Why does the author point out that ==“Indian grass, Canada wild rye, and native big bluestem all grew higher than a person”==? 

    A. to provide a reason why people from the eastern woodlands of the United States were impressed when they saw the prairie 

    B. to identified an **obstacles** to the development of the railroad lines fanning out from Chicago 

    C. to explain why the transformation of the prairies by commercial agriculture was **so remarkable** 

    D. to provide evidence supporting the claim that the prairies had fertile, deep black soil
